        <p>When individuals or communities propose a project to the ASF incubator,  it’s not uncommon to see reasons like “recognition” and “exposure to a wider community”.</p>
<p>While these are common reasons, they are not particularly good reasons.</p>
<p>Sure, the software created by many ASF projects is widely used. But, just as many, or more, are relatively unknown. ASF membership is not a ticket to ride. You still have to do the work.</p>
<p>The best reason for joining the ASF is because the development community supports the foundation’s mission.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the NCSA web server lost its only developer. NCSA was slow to replace the developer, and the project stagnated. Many of the people using the web server needed to make changes in<br>order to improve stability and scalability. People were posting and discussing patches on the mailing list, but there was no one available to make changes.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the mailing list subscribers banded together, setup their own version of the code, and started to apply their own patches. Not wanting to repeat history, the group organized itself in away that would avoid dependencies on a single developer or a single company.</p>
<p>Over time, the group evolved the notion of the Apache Way, which we now like to call ASF culture. We strongly believe that a codebase belongs to the individuals who create and maintain it, and that a codebase should be a collaboration between individuals. When we put these two ideas together, we come up with the term “meritocracy”, to describe an organization that is run by the people who do the actual work.</p>
<p>The ASF culture contrasts the model of the benign dictator described in Raymond’s The Cathedral and Bazaar. It is also very different that the Linux hierarchy. It’s a model that says any number of people can participate in a project, so long as everyone involved is prepared to work well with others … especially when we disagree.</p>
<p>In a word, our mission is collaboration.</p>
<p>In practice, we fulfill that mission by fostering software development communities. Everything that goes into that, the Apache License, the legal shield, the distribution policies, all speak to the fundamental mission of enabling collaboration.</p>
<p>As to ASF rules, after six years, I’ve been able to identify <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=apache_rules_002" title="eleven" target="_blank" rel="external">eleven</a>.</p>
<p>It’s true that working with others is often more work than going it alone. When the kids were young, my wife I would joke that the household chores take longer when the children help. But, nowadays, lo and behold, sometimes, the teens even do their own laundry!</p>
<p>It’s hard. But, it’s entirely worth it.</p>

<p>Since Jesse James Garrett coined the term Ajax in February 2005, the development landscape has exploded with Ajax frameworks, toolkits, and libraries. Although there are literally hundreds of libraries available today, two of the top contenders are the Dojo JavaScript Toolkit and the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library.</p>
<p>On a recent Ajax spike, my team created the same example application in both Dojo and YUI. Let’s compare the implementations, and see how the underlying Ajax products differ. Both Dojo and YUI are excellent products in their own way. But, which is the best fit for you, your application, and your organization?</p>
<p>Bio: Ted Husted is a software engineer and team mentor. His specialty is building agile web applications with open source products like Yahoo! User Interface Library, Struts, Spring, iBATIS, and MySQL, for either Java or Microsoft .NET, and helping others do the same.</p>
<p>Ted is a member of the Apache Software Foundation, an active member of the Apache Struts and Apache iBATIS projects, and co-founder of the Jakarta Commons. His books include JUnit in Action, Struts in Action, and Professional JSP Site Design. Ted has consulted with teams throughout the United States, including CitiGroup, Nationwide Insurance, and Pepsi Bottling Group. He is currently working with the Oklahoma State Department of Environmental Services to improve their permitting system.</p>

        <p>In practice, most applications are composed of a small number of workflows that repeat within the application. When configuration elements in different namespaces serve the same role, use the same identifier for each element. If each namespace includes a “Menu” or a “Help” action, use those same names with each namespace.</p>
<p>/receivables/Menu.jsp</p>
<!-- ... -->
<p>/payables/Menu.jsp</p>
<!-- ... -->
<p>Since the namespace feature avoids collisions between element names, we can increase cohesion within the application by using a consistent naming pattern.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The most common workflow in any business application I’ve every written or used is Find / List / Edit / View – or “FLEV”.</p>
<p>At work, our last two point applications used this workflow over and over again, and the third will be no different. Often we start with Finding and Listing one entity, which is then used to Find and List related entities, which have related entities of their own to List and Edit. And, of course, we also need to Edit and View any of these entities along the way.</p>
<p>For example in a mail reader, the software starts by finding the new posts for us and presenting a list. We then view the thread, and maybe call an editor to post another article. When posting, we might want to find and list entries from our address book, and either select or likely suspect, or view his or her details, and maybe make some changes.</p>
<p>So on and so forth.</p>
<p>One would think that a FLEV widget would be standard fare in any widget library. But, strangely not. Looking about, I find several types of tables and grids, many with inline editing and filtering. But, in real life, inline editing and filtering via a grid isn’t enough. We do need to rotate the axis and present a single entry on a form, often including fields not expressed on the grid.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been working with spanking-new DataTable from the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library. Under the hood, DataTable use a RecordSet to represent the raw set of entries, and a ColumnSet to describe the schema for an entry (data type, editor, formatter, short label, long label).</p>
<p>All that’s needed is a companion widget that can use the same Recordet and ColumnSet to present and edit one entry at a time.</p>
<p>Essentially, we’re talking about a widget can present the same data in four different ways. To get started, I created an issue ticket that described the widget in terms of these four views.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A FLEV widget would allow us to define a columnset and datasource once and use it to generate four presentations.</p>
<p>Finder - Columnset in vertical layout as a form with multifield dataentry and submit. Submit does not modify state. (Matching entries are presented through a Lister.) Some fields may be selectors with change events that update other selectors. Other fields may be calendars or sliders.</p>
<p>Lister - Columnset in horizontal layout as a grid with double-click single field editing. Command events to edit, view, delete, or add may be associated with selected row. Paging through rows is supported.</p>
<p>Editor - Columnset in vertical layout as a read-only panel. Command events may be available, such as save, save and add another, delete, or cancel.</p>
<p>Viewer - Columnset in vertical layout as a read-only panel. Command events may be available, such as edit, copy, delete, print, add, or cancel.<br>I got a good start on FLEV this week, and we are about ready to drop it into our application. Of course, the widget will be available as open source under the BSD license as the first installment of the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=cathedral" target="_blank" rel="external">Yazaar project</a>. Tomorrow is Struts 2 tip day, but I’ll be blogging more about FLEV over the weekend, including how it uses the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=yui_logreader" target="_blank" rel="external">YUI LogReader</a> as a development tool. Stay turned!</p>
