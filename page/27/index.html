<p>Since Jesse James Garrett coined the term Ajax in February 2005, the development landscape has exploded with Ajax frameworks, toolkits, and libraries. Although there are literally hundreds of libraries available today, two of the top contenders are the Dojo JavaScript Toolkit and the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library.</p>
<p>On a recent Ajax spike, my team created the same example application in both Dojo and YUI. Let’s compare the implementations, and see how the underlying Ajax products differ. Both Dojo and YUI are excellent products in their own way. But, which is the best fit for you, your application, and your organization?</p>

        <p>In practice, most applications are composed of a small number of workflows that repeat within the application. When configuration elements in different namespaces serve the same role, use the same identifier for each element. If each namespace includes a “Menu” or a “Help” action, use those same names with each namespace.</p>
<p>/receivables/Menu.jsp</p>
<!-- ... -->
<p>/payables/Menu.jsp</p>
<!-- ... -->
<p>Since the namespace feature avoids collisions between element names, we can increase cohesion within the application by using a consistent naming pattern.</p>

        <p>The most common workflow in any business application I’ve every written or used is Find / List / Edit / View – or “FLEV”.</p>
<p>At work, our last two point applications used this workflow over and over again, and the third will be no different. Often we start with Finding and Listing one entity, which is then used to Find and List related entities, which have related entities of their own to List and Edit. And, of course, we also need to Edit and View any of these entities along the way.</p>
<p>For example in a mail reader, the software starts by finding the new posts for us and presenting a list. We then view the thread, and maybe call an editor to post another article. When posting, we might want to find and list entries from our address book, and either select or likely suspect, or view his or her details, and maybe make some changes.</p>
<p>So on and so forth.</p>
<p>One would think that a FLEV widget would be standard fare in any widget library. But, strangely not. Looking about, I find several types of tables and grids, many with inline editing and filtering. But, in real life, inline editing and filtering via a grid isn’t enough. We do need to rotate the axis and present a single entry on a form, often including fields not expressed on the grid.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been working with spanking-new DataTable from the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library. Under the hood, DataTable use a RecordSet to represent the raw set of entries, and a ColumnSet to describe the schema for an entry (data type, editor, formatter, short label, long label).</p>
<p>All that’s needed is a companion widget that can use the same Recordet and ColumnSet to present and edit one entry at a time.</p>
<p>Essentially, we’re talking about a widget can present the same data in four different ways. To get started, I created an issue ticket that described the widget in terms of these four views.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A FLEV widget would allow us to define a columnset and datasource once and use it to generate four presentations.</p>
<p>Finder - Columnset in vertical layout as a form with multifield dataentry and submit. Submit does not modify state. (Matching entries are presented through a Lister.) Some fields may be selectors with change events that update other selectors. Other fields may be calendars or sliders.</p>
<p>Lister - Columnset in horizontal layout as a grid with double-click single field editing. Command events to edit, view, delete, or add may be associated with selected row. Paging through rows is supported.</p>
<p>Editor - Columnset in vertical layout as a read-only panel. Command events may be available, such as save, save and add another, delete, or cancel.</p>
<p>Viewer - Columnset in vertical layout as a read-only panel. Command events may be available, such as edit, copy, delete, print, add, or cancel.<br>I got a good start on FLEV this week, and we are about ready to drop it into our application. Of course, the widget will be available as open source under the BSD license as the first installment of the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=cathedral" target="_blank" rel="external">Yazaar project</a>. Tomorrow is Struts 2 tip day, but I’ll be blogging more about FLEV over the weekend, including how it uses the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=yui_logreader" target="_blank" rel="external">YUI LogReader</a> as a development tool. Stay turned!</p>

        <p><a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/%22" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Code</a> doesn’t seem to have release per se, or even announce when new features are added. Day by day, it just gets better and better.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the ninjas added to the automatic alerts. Yesterday, I was reviewing some issues and noticed that we can now edit all the issue details. Not long ago, the details were immutable. Now I can fix the issues inadvertently named “Enter one line summary”.</p>
<p>Here’s a run down of some other changes that I’ve noticed. Some of these may be older than others.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can now feature (or deprecate) wiki pages and downloads</li>
<li>We can mark an issue “notify me of issue changes”.</li>
<li>We can edit issue details.</li>
<li>There are now search filters for “My Issues”, “My Starred Issues”, and “Issues to Verify”, along with “All Issues” and “Open Issues”</li>
<li>Advanced issues search offers a “without the words” option, along with narrowing the search to labels, statuses, reporters, owners, and such.</li>
<li>The number of people who have starred an issue is tracked and reported (as an indication that they care).<br>One search filter that is missing is “Fixed” issues. The workaround for that is to enter the word “Fixed” into an all issues search. Ditto for “WontFix”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there is still miles to go. Right now, the four features that I miss most on Google Code are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=94" target="_blank" rel="external">JIRA/SVN style integration to support issue-driven-development</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=57" target="_blank" rel="external">Allow direct linking to issues from the wiki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=71" target="_blank" rel="external">ViewVC support</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=96" target="_blank" rel="external">Email notifications on changes to project setup</a><br>The “project setup notification” issue has been marked “Won’t Fix”, but hope springs eternal.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, even with these missing features, Google Code is still my favorite host, though admittedly because the tab interface makes everything so quick and easy to use.</p>
<p>Now, if we could just wrap Confluence, JIRA, Jive Forums, and (of course) Subversion in the same sort of interface, and get someone to set up a free open source hosting service – then we would really have <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=prim" target="_blank" rel="external">Team Best of Breed</a>!</p>
