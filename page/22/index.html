        <p><a href="http://www.jroller.com/TedHusted/entry/habits" target="_blank" rel="external">Last time</a>, we covered habits 1-4: <strong>Estimate</strong> (Be Proactive), <strong>Test-First</strong> (Begin with the End in Mind), <strong>Iterate</strong> (Put First Things First), and <strong>Narrate</strong> (Seek first to understand, and then to be understood).</p>
<ul>
<li>Refine (Think Win/Win)<br>Stable requirements are the holy grail of software development. If we do pursue the myth of stable requirements, clients and developers both lose. We may ship what the requirements describe, but we probably won’t ship what the client really wants and needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>When building business applications, a better approach is successive refinement. Rather than try to define in detail the application all at once, we first define and implement a key workflow. Through a series of iterations, we continue to extend and refine the workflows that comprise the application. The goal of each iteration is to provide client with functioning application that does useful work.</p>
<p>Successive refinement encourages clients and developers to act as collaborators, rather than adversaries, wrangling over requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reuse (Synergize)<br>A worker is only as good as his or her tools. As we create software that works, we look for ways to reuse that code in other projects. Few applications have totally unique requirements. Every application overlaps with the next. If arrange a codebase so that reusable components are separated from unique components, we usually increase cohesion and decrease coupling, creating software that is easier to change, extend, and reuse. By writing software so that it is easy to use more than once, we often create software that is easier to use even once.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Refactor (Sharpen the Saw)<br>Techniques like Test-First and Iterate help us write good code quickly, but great code still takes time and effort. As we verify that code is effective and relative, we can use our tests to help us refactor, or improve the design of existing code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well-designed code is easy to test and easy to change. Because we know new features will be easy to add, well-designed code doesn’t need “hooks” for future development. Code becomes an asset that pays dividends today and tomorrow. Refactoring is another win/win, since it helps us create better code today and happier clients tomorrow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentor<br>It’s said that we never truly understand a task until we teach it to someone else. Teaching creates a dialog between instructor and student. When the dialog is healthy, both student and instructor benefit. Teaching forces us to organize and prioritize our own knowledge, clarifying the task in our own minds. Clever students often ask questions we never thought to ask, and in finding the answers, we ourselves come to learn more. For me, writing this article is a case in point!</li>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Next to the gospel, my favorite self-help book is the <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/cl-institute/habits/habtoc.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</a>. The Habits apply to any endeavor, and I like to say that the Seven Habits is the first book any novice programmer should read. To help underscore why, here’s my humble homage to brother Steven Covey: The Eight Habits of Highly Effective Programmers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimate (or Be Proactive)<br>Programmers invent the future. It’s often hard for us to know how long something will take, because, often, we’ve never done this exact thing before. In the fictional series Star Trek, engineer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Scott" target="_blank" rel="external">Montgomery Scott</a> would triple his estimates, so as to seem like a miracle worker. Software engineers often have to triple estimates just to be in the right ballpark!</li>
</ul>
<p>Educators tell us that feedback is essential for learning. Before starting any programming task, write down an estimate first. After the task is done, compare your estimate with the actual result. Of course, all engineers are optimists, otherwise we couldn’t be engineers. But, with practice, we can learn what factor to apply to our internal estimates to match external events. (As implied, my factor is three!)</p>
<p>An easy way to get started with estimates is to keep a standup journal. Every day before starting work, jot down the most important task you did the last working day and the most important thing you hope to do today. Over time, you will develop a basis for comparing estimates with outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Test First (or Begin with the End in Mind)<br>Most projects budget at least some time for testing. Many projects schedule this time at the end, after the rest of the work is done. Tests serve two purposes. Run today, tests prove that our code works. Run tomorrow, tests prove that our code still works. Test-last development dilutes the value of tests. The earlier tests are written, the sooner they can tell us that the our code still works. Tests are most valuable when written before we write the implementation. By writing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321146530/husteddotcom-20" target="_blank" rel="external">test first</a>, we define what our code needs to do to succeed. As a result, we write only the code we need to write, no more, no less.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Iterate (or Put First Things First)<br>Creating effective software is a learning process. Each release addresses old needs and exposes new needs. Many software products are written for small workgroups, or focus groups of representative users. The sooner we deliver a product that the group can review, the sooner we can verify that established needs are being met, and the sooner we can identify new needs. Early verification is important, since programmers often misinterpret needs and write great code that solves the wrong problem. Writing code is easy. Identifying what code to write is hard. Early iterations help us create a positive feedback loop, so we can deliver better applications.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Narrate (Seek first to understand, then to be understood)<br>Many teams define an application through a series of <a href="http://strutsuniversity.org/Use+Cases" target="_blank" rel="external">use cases</a>, or plain-language workflows. To “set the stage”, a use case might begin with a narrative that describes one common instance of the workflow. The narrative often refers to a prototypical user and includes details of how that user would use the system under specific circumstances. By describing the workflow in plain language, from the user’s perspective, we can establish a dialog. Use cases help developers understand what clients want, and also help clients better understand what developers need to know to implement the workflow.</p>

        <p>The Expert Group for JSF 2.x is <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314" target="_blank" rel="external">now forming</a>, and people continue to consider <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Is-Struts-still-a-better-choice-over-JSF-as-on-today---tf4148557.html" target="_blank" rel="external">whether JSF is the right choice</a>.</p>
<p>To recap my own comments …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the thing: The vast majority of web applications are intranet application that we build in six to twelve weeks to serve a handful of users.</p>
<p>In a small-group intranet environment, server/bandwidth efficiency is not the limiting factor. The overriding concern is whether the application helps the people using it become more efficient. Do our people get more work done by using the application? Since we may be talking about five or twenty-five people connecting to a server on the next floor in the same building, scalability, in an environment like this, literally doesn’t matter. We still need a reasonable response time, but, often, people will forgive a slightly-longer response time for a more helpful user interface.</p>
<p>Of course, not all of us are building small-group intranet applications. If we have thousands of users who hit the application occasionally, from all over the world, our non-functional requirements can be quite different. Or, if we have a small group of users, but those users are working on the space shuttle, again, our requirements are going to be different. Different requirements imply different solutions.</p>
<p>There’s an old saw: Do you want it Fast, do you want it Right, or do you want it Soon? Pick any two.</p>
<p>For an intranet application, we might choose Right and Soon. (If it’s not right, no one will use it.) For an Internet application, we might pick Fast and Soon. (If it’s not fast, no one will use it.) For a space shuttle application, Fast and Right would more important than time to market (and we wouldn’t even use web technology!).</p>
<p>For an intranet application, JSF can be an excellent choice – if you have a group of developers that like working with Swing/VB type technology. For an Internet application, Struts can be an excellent choice – if you have a group of developers that like working with standard web technology.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake, in final analysis, it’s the developers that will make the difference. So, either use the technology that your team likes, or hire developers that like to use your technology. :)<br>In the realm of physics, in order to get any work done, we’ve had to resort to two separate, and seemingly contradictory, theories. Quantum theory is useful for calculations at an atomic scale, and general relativity is useful for calculations on a planetary scale. Either works fine on their own, and we don’t hesitate to put each to good use, but we’ve yet to find a way to reconcile the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience, the same principle applies to web development. Techniques that work well for small intranet applications may not work as well for busy Internet applications, and vice versa. When it comes to the craft of web development, one size does not fit all.</p>
<p><em>Vive la difference!</em></p>

        <p>While in Salt Lake City last week, I dropped by the <a href="http://www.ujug.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="external">Utah Java Users Group meeting</a> and gave my 33rd public presentation, my fourth appearance this year. I usually run about six presentations or courses a year. I’m already on the hook for The Ajax Experience (<a href="http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Boston</a>) in October, and ApacheCon (<a href="http://www.us.apachecon.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Atlanta</a>) in November, so it’s shaping up to be a busy year.</p>
<p>The UJUG gig was a last-minute thing. I was already in town to present a three day training course, so we dropped by, and the organizer, Chris Maki, setup up a special event for me during the “Break Out” session at the end. It had already been a busy night covering both SunSPOT robots, Java FX, and Java Scripting, but, even so, several stalwart Strutites hung around for the “special guest appearance”. I ran through the better part of my <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/oss/download/attachments/4942/building-s2-applications.pdf?version=2" target="_blank" rel="external">Building Struts 2 Applications</a> session, and answered a number of excellent questions.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing Struts presentations for six years now. The first, in June 2001, was a one-day “train the trainers” gig for an agency in Atlanta. Struts 1.0 was barely out the door, and before they asked, I had never thought of doing onsite Struts consulting. So, I had no slides, and no projector. We just met in a room with a flipchart, and hovered around my laptop for code demonstration, but at the end of the day, everyone there knew a lot more about Struts (including me!).</p>
<p>That sort of thing went on for several years. People would call and ask me to come out and work with their development team. We’d whip up an agenda, and, along the way, I started to build a library of slides, based on the what each team wanted to cover. Many times, we’d refine the agenda as we went, and I’d be creating or refining sessions in my hotel room the night before.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got tired of doing everything on the fly, and developed an actual training course. Being bloody-minded, my <a href="http://www.strutsuniversity.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Struts University courseware</a> is open source, just like Struts itsef. Right now, there are two tracts for the MailReader Training Course, one for teams new to Struts 2 and another for teams that are migrating from Struts 1. The base course is the same, but I change the initial presentation, as well as how the material is presented.</p>
<p>I’ve given the course several times now, and it seems to be working well. It’s a 50/50 mix of lecture and labs. The labs are designed to build the MailReader example application, use case by use case. We follow Agile principles, so each lab is an iteration that leaves us with a functioning application at the end.</p>
<p>I enjoy holding the courses, but I don’t actually enjoy traveling. I do it, but I don’t like it. Of course, it would be much more convenient if people would come here to Rochester NY. I did do a class here last summer, but it’s hard to know when to set a date. If anyone might be interested in coming to Rochester in December or May, or somewhere in between, <a href="http://husted.com/mentor/contact.html" target="_blank" rel="external">let me know</a>. At The Ajax Experience and ApacheCon, I’ll be speaking on Migrating to Ajax, so if that might be of interest as a full course, either here or there, let me know that too.</p>

        <p>Between July 2006 and June 2007, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) created thirteen new projects, bringing the total number of ASF software projects to just over fifty.</p>
<p>In June, the ASF Board of DiThe rectors promoted Jakarta Commons subproject to a top-level Apache Project. Over the past year, three other Jakarta subprojects – Velocity, Turbine, and POI – were promoted to top-level projects in 2006/2007. Other newly created projects include Apache Shale, Apache Tiles, Apache Santuario, Apache MINA, Apache Cayenne, Apache Felix, Apache OpenEJB, Apache OpenJPA, Apache Open for Business, and Apache Labs. Seven of the new projects were developed as part of other ASF projects, and then promoted to top-level projects, five projects are new to the foundation, and one was developed internally as a new top-level project.</p>
<p>Apache Velocity (<a href="http://velocity.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">velocity.apache.org</a>) is a Java-based template engine. The Velocity Engine is a mature product, in distribution since 2001. In addition to the core Velocity Engine, the new Apache Velocity project offers five other related products. The latest addition is Velocity DocBook Framework (DBF), a framework for creating high-quality online or print documentation. DBF (<a href="http://velocity.apache.org/docbook" target="_blank" rel="external">velocity.apache.org/docbook</a>) simplifies rendering DocBook files by combining Apache Ant, Java, and the Velocity Engine into a unified toolset.</p>
<p>Apache Turbine (<a href="http://turbine.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">turbine.apache.org</a>) is a servlet-based web application framework. Turbine and Velocity share common roots, and like Apache Velocity, Apache Turbine is a mature product dating back to 2001. Turbine works well with both Velocity templates and JavaServer Pages, and supports a services-oriented architecture.</p>
<p>Apache POI (<a href="http://poi.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">poi.apache.org</a>) provides a set of pure Java APIs for working with Microsoft OLE 2 documents, which includes Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. POI is in its third major release series. In addition to Java support, POI also provides bindings for the popular Ruby language. Like Velocity and Turbine, Apache POI is another mature codebase in development since 2001.</p>
<p>Apache Shale and Apache Tiles are spin-offs from the Apache Struts project. Apache Shale (<a href="http://shale.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">shale.apache.org</a>) is a modern web application framework, fundamentally based on JavaServer Faces. The Shale codebase was originally created in 2004 by Craig McClanahan, who also founded Apache Struts.</p>
<p>Apache Tiles (<a href="http://tiles.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">tiles.apache.org</a>) is a templating framework for use with web applications. Originally an Apache Struts feature, Tiles has been broadened into a standalone framework. Both Apache Struts and Apache Shale provide Tiles support as a standard option.</p>
<p>Formerly known as XML Security, Apache Santuario (<a href="http://santuario.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">santuario.apache.org</a>) provides implementations of the W3C standard XML-Signature Syntax and XML Encription Syntax. Libraries are now available for use with Java or C++ applications. Before being promoted to a top-level project, Santuario was part of the Apache XML project. The original Java codebase was a commercial product, donated to the foundation in 2001.</p>
<p>Apache MINA (<a href="http://mina.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">mina.apache.org</a>) provides a unified API for transport types, byte buffers, message objects, and codecs, along with stream-based IO support and a Java Filter interface. The MINA codebase (Multipurpose Infrastructure for Network Applications) began as a merger of the Netty network application framework with a Staged Event Driven Architecture (SEDA). Today, it is a core dependency of the Apache Directory project. Apache MINA also powers point of sale terminals, multiplayer games, and other network systems.</p>
<p>Apache Cayenne (<a href="http://cayenne.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">cayenne.apache.org</a>) is an object relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java that combines many of the best features of Apache iBATIS and Hibernate, and then adds a sophisticated GUI modeling tool. Cayenne was first developed by ObjectStyle, LLC., and donated to the ASF in 2006. The codebase has been actively developed since 2001, and Apache Cayenne is now in its second major release series, with version 3.0 in development. An exciting feature of Apache Cayenne 3.0 will be a Java Persistence API (JPA) provider.</p>
<p>Apache Felix (<a href="http://felix.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">felix.apache.org</a>) is a community effort to implement OSGi-related technologies. OSGi technology targets embedded devices and home services gateways, but it is ideally suited for any project that is interested in principles of modularity, component-oriented, and/or service-orientation. Among other things, OSGi technologies can be used as an alternative to Java Management Extension (JMX).</p>
<p>Apache OpenEJB (<a href="http://openejb.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">openejb.apache.org</a>) is a modular, configurable, and extendable EJB Container System and EJB Server. Over the last seven years, the OpenEJB group worked with two other open source hosts, Exolab and CodeHaus, before coming to the ASF in 2006. The current release of Apache OpenEJB supports the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 specification. The product ships with both a EJB container system and its own lightweight EJB server. Apache OpenEJB can also be embedded into Apache Tomcat to create “a no holds-barred EJB server”.</p>
<p>Apache OpenJPA (<a href="http://openjpa.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">openjpa.apache.org</a>) is a feature-rich implementation of the persistence part of Enterprise Java Beans 3.0, also known as the Java Persistence API (JPA). OpenJPA can be used as a stand-alone POJO persistence layer, or it can be integrated into any EJB3.0 compliant container and many lightweight frameworks. The OpenJPA codebase was originally developed by BEA and later donated to the foundation in 2006. OpenJPA is already being used by ActiveMQ, BEA, Apache Camel, Apache Geronimo, Apache Ode, Apache OpenEJB, Spring, and IBM WebShere, among others.</p>
<p>Apache Open for Business (<a href="http://ofbiz.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">ofbiz.apache.org</a>) is an enterprise automation package that includes tools for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Software Configuration Management (SCM), Materials Resource Planning (MRP), and more. OFBiz was originally created in May 2001 and soon attracted an international base of developers, contributors, and users before joining the foundation in 2006. Today, OfBiz powers a wide variety of ecommerce sites, including 1-800-flowers.com and totes-isotoner.com.</p>
<p>While many ASF projects were created elsewhere, another new project, Apache Labs (<a href="http://labs.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">labs.apache.org</a>), is designed as a place where ASF committers can experiment with new ideas. In the Apache Labs, our committers can innovate and collaborate, without the worry of building a community first. Today’s labs – which may be tomorrow’s projects – range from new approaches to creating virtual communities to experiments in new web protocols.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation (<a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">www.apache.org</a>) is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the Apache community of open-source software projects. While the foundation’s infrastructure is funded through a combination of <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html" target="_blank" rel="external"> sponsorships</a> and <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html" target="_blank" rel="external">donations</a>, the foundation itself is composed of individual, unpaid volunteers. ASF projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software.</p>
