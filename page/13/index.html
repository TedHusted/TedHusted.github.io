        <p><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneDrive_Groups" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Windows_Live_Groups.png" alt=""></a></div><br>In June 2010, Microsoft revamped its Microsoft Live offerings to make better use of its SkyDrive online file storage system and Microsoft Web Apps platform, and to align Web Apps with the <a href="http://www.docs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">docs.com website</a>, targeted squarely at Facebook users.</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Windows Live Office Groups</a> is a free service for the personal use of groups of up to a thousand of your closest peeps. The only catch is that everyone needs a (free) Windows Live ID. Although Groups is free for personal use, every page on the site does includes a sidebar advertisement (annoying, animated advertisements). One other current restriction is that there is a limit on the number of groups one Windows Live account can create or join. You can create up to 20 groups (using one account), and join up to a total of 40.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the browser list is longer than you might expect. (A clear signal that MS is ready to complete with Google in the online office space.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: Firefox 3.5 or later versions, Chrome 3 or later versions</li>
<li><strong>Mac</strong>: Safari 4 or later versions, Firefox 3.5 or later versions, Chrome 3 or later versions</li>
<li><p><strong>Windows:</strong> Internet Explorer versions 7 and 8, Firefox 3.5 or later versions, and Chrome 3 or later versions.<br>Each group has its own set of areas for Discussions, Documents, Photos, Calendar, Membership, and SkyDrive. The navigation is clean and simple. Anyone who understands breadcrumbs should have no trouble bouncing between area. There is also a modest selection of alternative styles dress up the navigation bar.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Discussions</strong> - A simple but effective online forum, making it easy for members to post messages without CC’ing the world. Administrative features including editing and deleting posts, and deleting entire discussions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Documents</strong> - Any type of file can be uploaded, and you can edit the permission to restrict usage. Office documents can be viewed or edited online, or downloaded and edited locally (if you have the corresponding Office application installed). Editing or uploading a document creates a new version automatically. It’s even easy to flip between versions and restore an older one, if need be.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Photos</strong> - Create albums and upload images to share with the group.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Calendar</strong> - Track key dates on the group’s calendar and integrate with your own calendar and with calendars for other groups. There is also an option for a daily email alert of upcoming events.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Membership </strong>- Each participant can be in one of three security roles: Owner, Co-Owner, and Member. The Owner can be changed, and only the owner can delete a group.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Group Landing Page</strong> - The main page for the group summarizes activity from the other areas, making it easy to see what’s happening.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The group may also have an “Email group” feature which works like a mailing list. The confusing bit is that some messages will end up in the Discussion area and some will end up in email, diluting the effectiveness of both.  A third endpoint for discussions is group chat. If enabled, up to forty people in your group members can pile on via Windows Messenger.</p>
<p>The group email feature can be turned off, and individual members can opt out of group email. The missing option is email alerts for discussions. Also missing is a RSS feed of the group’s activities.</p>
<p>For extra credit, <a href="http://smallbusiness.officelive.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="external">you can also create a free website</a> for your group (or other purpose) – but that would be yet another series.</p>
<p>Like Google Apps and Google Sites, Windows Live and Office Live Groups offer a broad platform that can be targeted for specific projects. Next week, we will close up the Workgroup Site series with a look at Open Atrium, another example of narrowing a broad platform.</p>

The site provides “thoroughly researched, impartial and accessible resources about software to help nonprofits make smart software decisions.”</p>
<p>There are a number of Idealware reports available, including the <a href="http://www.idealware.org/homepage-features/field-guide-feature2" target="_blank" rel="external">Field guide to Software for Nonprofits</a>, and most recently, the<a href="http://www.idealware.org/reports/nonprofit-social-media-decision-guide" target="_blank" rel="external"> Nonprofit Social Media Decision Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The Decision Guide is an exquisite 70-page whitepaper crammed with practical advice that any nonprofit can put to work today. The guide covers Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, Photo Sharing, Video Sharing, and additional social media channels.</p>
<p>The material is based directly on original research conducted by Idealware. For each media, Idealware provides solid guidelines on getting the most for your time and effort.</p>
<p>The guide also highlights interesting and entertaining comments taken from the survey. And Idealware is not shy about providing their own analysis, such as “As a rule of thumb, set aside at least two hours each week for each social media channel.”</p>
<p>If you’re wondering whether to focus on Twitter or Blogs, or Facebook versus Flickr, this <a href="http://www.idealware.org/reports/nonprofit-social-media-decision-guide" target="_blank" rel="external">whitepaper </a>is for you.</p>
<p>My only raised eyebrow is that the guide marginalized LinkedIn. My viewpoint may be skewed from involvement in professional organizations, but LinkedIn and LinkedIn forums are my preferred social networks.</p>
<p>According to the guide, for most nonprofits, a Facebook page will yield the best bang for the buck, if you have the time to maintain it, but the key is to integrate your communication strategy into a “cohesive whole”. For details, see the guide :)</p>
<p>I do have to say that the writing is simply excellent. Everything about the guide screams quality and attention to detail. If you only read one Social Media resource this year, let it be <a href="http://www.idealware.org/reports/nonprofit-social-media-decision-guide" target="_blank" rel="external">Idealware’s Decision Guide</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Calendar Location Maps with Get Directions.</strong> By tieing in with Google Maps, we can extend the standard iMIS calendar to provide a location map, and then pop-off to Google Maps for directions. A great, low-cost way to enhance the standard iMIS event calendar.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Custom Members Directory.</strong> The standard iMIS Public View Directory pulls from the members database, and it’s easy to configure, but PV Directories comes with several constraints. Everything has to fit on one row, there’s no detail view, and it’s public. With a custom directory, we can add a detail page, link email or website addresses, restrict access, and more.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Member Join.</strong> With standard Public Views, people can create free web accounts. We can extend the join process to include paying members, and collect whatever additional demographics your organization needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Join during event registration.</strong> Often, member pricing for an event is a great inducement to join some organizations. We can make applying for membership a seamless extension to event registration, so that your newest members can join without a second thought.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bypass email confirmation during account create.</strong> The standard account create process includes an email confirmation step that confuses many new users and generates support calls. With a simple change, we can bypass the email confirmation, to reduce support costs and increase user satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Support duplicate email address.</strong> Out of the box, Public Views has trouble coping with members who share an email address, especially when a password needs to be reset. We can extend the base workflow so that members can share email addresses, without resetting each other’s password.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ajax login notification for event registration.</strong> When accessing an event, the standard iMIS login prompt is buried on the screen and often missed. With our Ajax notification solution, it becomes easy for users to login and complete registration, without confusion or support calls.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Limited number of complementary sponsor registrations.</strong> If your organization offers sponsors a set number of complementary registrations, we can extend Public Views to cap the number of free registrations per sponsor.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Readonly profile fields.</strong> If there are some profile fields that members should see but not touch, we can make selected fields read-only.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extend profile with custom pages.</strong> iMIS has great demographics, but sometimes an organization needs a more comprehensive profile. We can extend the profile with custom pages, to make it easier for members to maintain their own configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Downloadable documents </strong>(after purchase). In this virtual world, many digital publications have value to your members. With Download Documents, users can purchase the right to a copy of a document, spreadsheet, PDF, presentation, or image, and then download it from a personal portal page.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Flexible payments.</strong> We also have solutions for discount coupons and installment dues, to provide members more flexibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We often integate iMIS with Ektron websites, which creates some other great opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ektron/iMIS provider.</strong> Our Ektron SSO solution authenticates web site users against iMIS and lets us create web site authentication groups based on iMIS critera.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Community Workgroups</strong> with your choice of Calendar, Forum, and/or Documents pages. Most organizations have working groups that need to collaborate. By combining Ektron communities with iMIS demographics, we can automate the creation and maintenance of collaborative groups, with access to their own Calendar, Forum, and Document library.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dues Alerts at Login.</strong> Keeping up with dues is an easy thing for members to let slip. With a Dues Alerts, we post a dynamic reminder on the website that displays when members log in and have outstanding dues.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ektron Blog Aggregator.</strong> If you’d like to post blogs on your website, but don’t have the internal staff to keep it up, consider gathering together (or aggregating) your member blogs. Other members can visit your site, take in all the summaries of peer blogs at a glance, and click through to view the detail on the original site. An aggregator is a great way to build synergy between your member’s and your organization’s web sites.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>MyPage. </strong>With the Ektron/iMIS provider, we can create individual profile pages that combine the best of iMIS demographics and Ektron social media controls. Members can choose among a selection of widgets to create their own custom dashboard.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Conference Page.</strong> We have several approaches to creating microsites around your organizations conference, increasing usability and reducing maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple Location Maps.</strong> If your organization has several locations, we can help you create a map of all your offices and allow users to drill down on any location for more detail and directions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Flush web cache</strong> to show latest updates. High performance site are often aggressively cached. We can provide a simple for flushing the cache on demand, so that your members get the latest updates as soon as they are redy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we haven’t done your customization – yet – be sure to give us a call, and we can discuss doing iMIS or Ektron <strong><em>your</em></strong> way.</p>

        <p>Here’s a run down of three events coming up soon.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Rochester Java Users Group, Tue 14 Sep </span></p>
<p>A career focused meeting with a panel of three recruiters discussing how the job market has changed. People go about searching for new opportunities in a different way, hiring companies look for new talent differently, and the recruiter’s role has changed as well - compared to the 80-ies/90-ies way of browsing the local newspaper and sending letters.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to update yourself on how the (job) world now works, to participate in an interactive evening featuring open discussion between developers and the panelists. The panelists are David Calus of E-R Associates, David Sable of TEKSystems and Eric Derby, The Software Scout.</p>
<p>Meetings start at 6:00 pm and end around 8:00 pm, and take place on the Second floor of the Golisano building, at RIT, room GOL-2400. Directions to RIT can be found at <a href="http://www.rjug.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">www.rjug.org</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Digital Rochester “Get Connected!”, Tue 5 Oct</span></p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, October 5th, 2010, Digital Rochester is hosting its eighth annual Get Connected! networking event (<a href="http://digitalrochester.com/events/previous-events/networking/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://digitalrochester.com/events/previous-events/networking/</a>). The evening showcases select organizations in the Greater Rochester area that provide professional networking and service opportunities for their members.</p>
<p>The annual event is DR’s biggest networking gathering of the year, welcoming a remarkable mix of Rochester’s best. There will be tech groups, professional associations and service organizations – altogether a great way to find opportunities for you to plug into good things happening in the greater Rochester region!</p>
<p>Get Connected! will be in the very cool <a href="http://rocwiki.org/Village_Gate" target="_blank" rel="external">second floor atrium of Village Gate</a>, right in the heart of Rochester’s Neighborhood of the Arts. Check out the sculptures, two story mobiles and artwork hanging from the ceiling! It’s an intriguing space and a one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with all of these great organizations in one place at one time!</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">IIBA Rochester NY “User Stores”, Wed 6 Oct </span></p>
<p><a href="http://rochesterny.theiiba.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">IIBA Rochester NY</a> will host a live webinar with Susan Burk on Wed Oct 6 at NimbleUser, 656 Kreag Road, Pittsford NY 14534. Susan will speak on the subject of user stories and use cases.</p>
