        <p>The most common workflow in any business application I’ve every written or used is Find / List / Edit / View – or “FLEV”.</p>
<p>At work, our last two point applications used this workflow over and over again, and the third will be no different. Often we start with Finding and Listing one entity, which is then used to Find and List related entities, which have related entities of their own to List and Edit. And, of course, we also need to Edit and View any of these entities along the way.</p>
<p>For example in a mail reader, the software starts by finding the new posts for us and presenting a list. We then view the thread, and maybe call an editor to post another article. When posting, we might want to find and list entries from our address book, and either select or likely suspect, or view his or her details, and maybe make some changes.</p>
<p>So on and so forth.</p>
<p>One would think that a FLEV widget would be standard fare in any widget library. But, strangely not. Looking about, I find several types of tables and grids, many with inline editing and filtering. But, in real life, inline editing and filtering via a grid isn’t enough. We do need to rotate the axis and present a single entry on a form, often including fields not expressed on the grid.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been working with spanking-new DataTable from the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library. Under the hood, DataTable use a RecordSet to represent the raw set of entries, and a ColumnSet to describe the schema for an entry (data type, editor, formatter, short label, long label).</p>
<p>All that’s needed is a companion widget that can use the same Recordet and ColumnSet to present and edit one entry at a time.</p>
<p>Essentially, we’re talking about a widget can present the same data in four different ways. To get started, I created an issue ticket that described the widget in terms of these four views.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A FLEV widget would allow us to define a columnset and datasource once and use it to generate four presentations.</p>
<p>Finder - Columnset in vertical layout as a form with multifield dataentry and submit. Submit does not modify state. (Matching entries are presented through a Lister.) Some fields may be selectors with change events that update other selectors. Other fields may be calendars or sliders.</p>
<p>Lister - Columnset in horizontal layout as a grid with double-click single field editing. Command events to edit, view, delete, or add may be associated with selected row. Paging through rows is supported.</p>
<p>Editor - Columnset in vertical layout as a read-only panel. Command events may be available, such as save, save and add another, delete, or cancel.</p>
<p>Viewer - Columnset in vertical layout as a read-only panel. Command events may be available, such as edit, copy, delete, print, add, or cancel.<br>I got a good start on FLEV this week, and we are about ready to drop it into our application. Of course, the widget will be available as open source under the BSD license as the first installment of the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=cathedral" target="_blank" rel="external">Yazaar project</a>. Tomorrow is Struts 2 tip day, but I’ll be blogging more about FLEV over the weekend, including how it uses the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=yui_logreader" target="_blank" rel="external">YUI LogReader</a> as a development tool. Stay turned!</p>

        <p><a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/%22" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Code</a> doesn’t seem to have release per se, or even announce when new features are added. Day by day, it just gets better and better.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the ninjas added to the automatic alerts. Yesterday, I was reviewing some issues and noticed that we can now edit all the issue details. Not long ago, the details were immutable. Now I can fix the issues inadvertently named “Enter one line summary”.</p>
<p>Here’s a run down of some other changes that I’ve noticed. Some of these may be older than others.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can now feature (or deprecate) wiki pages and downloads</li>
<li>We can mark an issue “notify me of issue changes”.</li>
<li>We can edit issue details.</li>
<li>There are now search filters for “My Issues”, “My Starred Issues”, and “Issues to Verify”, along with “All Issues” and “Open Issues”</li>
<li>Advanced issues search offers a “without the words” option, along with narrowing the search to labels, statuses, reporters, owners, and such.</li>
<li>The number of people who have starred an issue is tracked and reported (as an indication that they care).<br>One search filter that is missing is “Fixed” issues. The workaround for that is to enter the word “Fixed” into an all issues search. Ditto for “WontFix”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there is still miles to go. Right now, the four features that I miss most on Google Code are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=94" target="_blank" rel="external">JIRA/SVN style integration to support issue-driven-development</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=57" target="_blank" rel="external">Allow direct linking to issues from the wiki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=71" target="_blank" rel="external">ViewVC support</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=96" target="_blank" rel="external">Email notifications on changes to project setup</a><br>The “project setup notification” issue has been marked “Won’t Fix”, but hope springs eternal.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, even with these missing features, Google Code is still my favorite host, though admittedly because the tab interface makes everything so quick and easy to use.</p>
<p>Now, if we could just wrap Confluence, JIRA, Jive Forums, and (of course) Subversion in the same sort of interface, and get someone to set up a free open source hosting service – then we would really have <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=prim" target="_blank" rel="external">Team Best of Breed</a>!</p>

        <p>I’ve never been a logging enthusiast. Many of the frameworks I use put logging to good use, but it not something I’ve felt compelled to inject into my own applications.</p>
<p>Many coders use logging as a development aid. One of my earliest Turbo Pascal programs wrote a character to the menu bar as a “tell”. As the application moved through a workflow, the tell would change. If it hung up, I knew where to start looking. It started as a development aid, but I left it in the production code because, well, it looked cool!</p>
<p>For most developers, our desire to log takes seed with a quick write to standard out, and blossoms as world-class products like Log4J, Log4Net, Log4PHP, and the other flowers in the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apache Logging</a> bouquet.</p>
<p>Rather use loggers as a development aid, these days I tend to set a lot of breakpoints as I develop. I like to follow brother Steve McConnell’s advice from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619670/husteddotcom-20" target="_blank" rel="external">Code Complete</a>. Every time I write a new swatch of code, first, I set a breakpoint and watch it run.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Joe Hewitt’s brilliant <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank" rel="external">FireBug plugin</a> is one of my new best friends these days. Running a close second is the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library’s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/logger/" target="_blank" rel="external">Logger</a>.</p>
<p>Like other implementations, the YUI Logger works as a singleton, so it’s very easy to write a logging message from anywhere in the application.</p>
<pre><code>// Assigns default category &quot;info&quot; and default source &quot;global&quot;
YAHOO.log(&quot;My log message&quot;); `&lt;/pre&gt;
As implied by the comment, we can add categories and source parameters to the method call, which are also standard fare for logging systems.

The trick with JavaScript logging is viewing the messages. Most of the Apache Logging bunch rely on logging to console or to a shared file for the application. Some browsers do support a JavaScript console window, but it&apos;s not a standard feature. For JavaScript, we need to shift the paradigm.

But it&apos;s not such a big shift. Since YUI is a widget library, it would make sense to express the Logger Control (or LogReader) as a widget. To view the messages as they are logged, just add the LogReader widget to an application, again with one whole line of code.
&lt;pre&gt;`var myLogReader = new YAHOO.widget.LogReader(); `&lt;/pre&gt;
By default, the LogReader widget plants itself in the top right corner of the browser window. If that arrangement doesn&apos;t work for you, the widget can also be attached to a div or dragged around the screen. If the window box still feels cluttered, there a builtin &quot;Collapse&quot; button. To be even more unobtrusive, you can add your own button to show or hide the widget.

An especially good use of logging in a JavaScript application is to document when events fire. Widgets raise primitive events like &quot;click&quot;. A well-designed application will handle those events and raise an &quot;idiomatic&quot; event of its own. We can rely on the widget to raise its event, the interesting bit is when we raise our own.

Case in point, we&apos;re working on a DataForm widget that can share a RecordSet and ColumnSet with a YUI DataTable. The form widget raises &quot;update&quot; and &quot;insert&quot; events for the benefit of a client controller application. In early testing of the widget, we can&apos;t see those events happen, because they haven&apos;t been wired to a client yet. But, we can use a logger to view the events as they are raised.
&lt;pre&gt;`oSelf.fireEvent(&quot;updateEvent&quot;,context);
oSelf.logRecordEvent(&quot;updateEvent&quot;, oRecord, oOldRecord); // debug
</code></pre><p>Where logRecordEvent is a helper method that expresses the oRecord and oOldRecord data in human-readable JSON.</p>
<p>We could also set breakpoints to check that the events fire, and the first time around, we still do. But, the logging statements are also a rudimentary unit test. In fact, the next step might be to create Selenium tests that look for logging statements on our example pages.</p>
<p>The YUI library distribution includes *-debug version of all the modules that include this kind of logging statement. The production version has the logging statement extracted. (Leaving a few strange lines of code behind, like empty else statements.)</p>
<p>Of course, there would be a few ways to filter production code for logging statements. <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/11598" target="_blank" rel="external">I don’t know what YUI does</a>, but for my own projects, I might try an <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=aptana" target="_blank" rel="external">Aptana</a> action to do the dirty work.</p>
<p>Though, since the LogReader can be flipped on and off, it’s not hard to imagine leaving some statements embedded, for the sake of technical support. So, for now, we’re marking the logging lines “// debug” in case we decide to leave some in later.</p>
<p>I may never love logging quite as much as Ceki, but the YUI LogReader is at least a friend with benefits!</p>

        <p>As much as I enjoy blogging through JRoller, I thought I’d spend the month of April taking other blogging systems for a spin. I’ll let each trial run for a week, but to keep it sane, I’ll continue to archive each blog to the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted" target="_blank" rel="external">JRoller page</a>.</p>
<p>First in line is <a href="http://www.simplephpblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Simple PHP Blog</a>. This isn’t a blogging site, like JRoller, Blogger, or 360. It’s a PHP script that a can be installed on a conventional server for a single user.</p>
<p>Installing Simple PHP Blog is, well, simple. Upload the script, set the permissions, and run the index.php. With <a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">FileZilla</a>, it can all be done using drag, drop, and click.</p>
<p>Since SPB is intended for people with server access, there isn’t an editing feature for the themes. But, if you were able to install SPB, it’s not any harder to edit the file and drop it onto the server. In practice, it’s no different than editing a Roller theme.</p>
<p>One nice feature is the sidebar text box widget. To get an “About Me” blurb into JRoller, I had to edit the theme. With SPB, I could just add a text box through the configuration menu that comes up in the sidebar. On the website, the developer is testing a new widget feature, to make it easier to add other customizations to the sidebar.</p>
<p>One nice thing for me is that SPB generates arbitrary permalinks IDs. JRoller used a hash of the name, which induced me to use my own hash for the title, save the entry, and then change the title to be human-friendly.</p>
<p>SPB uses a BBS code markup for the entries and comments. Instead of using HTML tags like , we use pidgin tags like [url=][/url]. There’s a wizard for building the tags, but once you’ve seen an example, they are just as easy to create by hand.</p>
<p>Eventually, I’ll probably do a feature grid. For now, it seems like SPB has rounded up all the “usual suspect” features, at least in the context of a single-user blog installed on your own server. The next question will be whether my server is any more reliable than JRoller’s :)</p>
<p>To access the blog system of the week, follow the <a href="http://husted.com/ted/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://husted.com/ted/blog/index.html</a>. Feel free to re-up for the feed, so as to give each system a fair test. Of course, if anyone has a preference or other feedback, feel free to comment.</p>

<p>Revolution - Stick a fork in it and see who bites.</p>
<p>Veto - Severe change reduction.</p>
<p>+1 - A negative veto.</p>
