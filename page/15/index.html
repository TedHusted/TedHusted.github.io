        <p>ASI watchers may have noticed an uptick in patches lately. That’s no fluke says Mark Breland of ASI. It’s all part of an initiative to shorten development cycles and put code improvements into the field sooner.</p>
<p>One offshoot of that development initiative is ASI’s plans to open source its IBO product. iBO (iMIS Business Objects) is the standard way to integrate iMIS with other products or one-off customizations.</p>
<p><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://opensource.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://opensource.org/files/garland_logo.png" alt=""></a></div><br>ASI is working with its partners community version of iBO. Following up on a recent webinar, ASI has invited several interested volunteers to form a steering committee to manage an open source community product spun off from the current iBO code base. Five volunteers were on the kickoff call – Bruce Wilson (McGladrey), Randy Richter (Association Technology Solutions), Jason Voccia (Computer System Innovations), Ted Husted (NimbleUser), and Troy Stenback (ASI Consulting) – along with Mark Breland of ASI.</p>
<p>The working plan is that ASI will donate the code and host a repository and case management system, and provide a collaborative space for the project. ASI will continue to maintain its own “enterprise” version separately, and the ASI version will be the only code base supported by ASI itself. Meanwhile, the steering committee will have full control over the “community” version, leaving us free to apply whatever patches or improvements to the “community” version as we deem fit.</p>
<p>While some of the volunteers (including myself) are concerned about creating a “fork” of the iBO code base, we came to see it as a stepping stone toward a more complete open source model. Our hope is that ASI will adopt our fixes and improvements into the “enterprise” version, and also supply patches to the “community” version, to help the code bases remain in sync. Initially, =each code base would be maintained separately, and ASI will remain in complete control of the official “enterprise” version.</p>
<p>The committee’s hope is that once we prove ourselves, we might be able to reunite the codebases in the future. But, in the meantime, we are eager to make the best use of the enterprise/community model.</p>
<p>Our next steps are to draft our “Rules of Engagement”, setup a mailing list, and look to ASI to setup the repository and case tracking tools, and settle some of the loose ends with Legal. I caught the short straw for drafting the Rules, but I can draw on experience with open source projects like Apache Struts and the Jakarta Commons, to help give us a solid starting point.</p>
<p>As a note, there are similarities between the Open iBO initiatve and the origin of Apache Tomcat. Sun originally donated a Java plugin to the Apache Software Foundation. Under the name “Tomcat”, the ASF  extended and rewrote the codebase, and over the years, the ASF grew the product into a full-featured web server. A recent market survey indicates that today Tomcat has a 64% market share (<a href="http://ztrek.blogspot.com/2007/10/bea-oracle-market-share.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://ztrek.blogspot.com/2007/10/bea-oracle-market-share.html</a>).</p>
<p>Keep watch here for further news about Open Source iBO. I’m looking forward to living through some “interesting times” with ASI.<br>-Ted.</p>

        <p>The first <a href="http://www.fosscon.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">FOSScon Northeast</a> was attended by a dedicated group of fifty enthusiasts this Saturday at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Henrietta NY, some coming from as far as Detroit to be immersed in a day of open source brouhaha. The Free Open Source Software (FOSS) convention included three tracks – Education, Business, and Home – along with two workshop tracks. The day also included Birds of a Feature sessions (special interest groups), and a round of lightening talks, where people gave a five-minute presentation on some FOSS topic.</p>
<p>My colleague Tom Patros and I lead a Drupal Kickstart workshop. We ran into projector problems, but the group was small enough that we were able to run the workshop up close and personal. I lead another talk later in the day entitled Open Source Secret Sauce. The decks for both talks are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ted.husted" target="_blank" rel="external">up on SlideShare</a>.</p>
<p>In preparing for the Kickstart, we came across a couple of interesting\ cloud-based Drupal hosts. The DrupalCafe offers a free stock Drupal 6 site that is easy to setup and administer. The site does not allow you to install your own themes or modules, but certain extensions can be added on request. Another great starter site is the DreamHostApp. At this site, you can automatically setup a Drupal site, as well as Wordpress, PHPBBS, Zen, and Google Apps site, all in one click. If you ever wanted to take any or all of these “best of breed” products for a test-drive, <a href="http://www.dreamhostapps.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">DreamHost is your ticket to ride</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FOSSCon One did suffer from the usual number of issues for a first-time conference. The website lacked detail. An overabundance of tracks and workshops lead to holding sessions in separate buildings. The lunch sponsor fell through, so attendees were left to fend for themselves. The tracks lacked a proctor to distribute and collect evaluations or to prompt speakers at the end of their sessions. But we all made the best of it, and many talks turned into intimate dialogs between people with a deep commitment to open source products.</p>
<p>One great takeaway for me was the notion of using Drupal for professional certification exams. The session leader had started with Moodle and then added Drupal. Since then the Drupal polls and rules modules came out, which together could make Drupal an excellent platform for certification exams.</p>
<p>In another session, my friend Chaz Profit highlighted the trend for open courseware. The prime example is <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">MIT’s OCW site</a>, which now has the materials for over 1900 courses online. The courseware includes lecture notes, sample exams and solutions, and even video lectures. Following MIT’s lead, more and more professors are developing an open and collaborative attitude toward sharing syllabi.</p>
<p>I also ran into Onno Kluyt, former lead of Sun’s Java Community Process (JCP). Onno is now living here in Webster NY, with his own <a href="http://onno-consulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">software consulting practice</a>. Afterwards, we caught up at Quinby’s, recounting stories of the dynamics between Sun and the Apache Software Foundation. The ASF hosts about fifty headstrong Java projects, which created some “interesting times” for Sun. (And now Oracle.)</p>
<p>Already plans are underway for FOSSCon 2011, and you can count me in. If you’d like to help out or stay in touch, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#%21/pages/FOSSCON/299401805981" target="_blank" rel="external">like the Facebook</a>. Whether you made it out this year or not, there is also an <a href="http://bit.ly/cc9Zim" target="_blank" rel="external">exit survey online</a>.</p>

        <p>Rochester Security Summit October 20-21st, 2010, Rochester NY, <a href="http://rochestersecurity.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://RochesterSecurity.org/</a></p>
<p>The fifth annual Rochester Security Summit is being planned for October 20-21 in Rochester, NY and is looking for top speakers. This year there will be three tracks: Business Professional, Technical Professional, and Software Professional.</p>
<p>If you believe you have a significant research or technical presentation that the security community would value and enjoy hearing, we invite you to submit your presentation topic for consideration.</p>
<p>All three tracks will consist of presentations in 50-minute blocks, including Q&amp;A. Presentations may be allowed to span two blocks to accommodate topic exploration to different depths if the committee sees the merit in the longer time allotment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please submit your proposal submissions before July 27, 2010.</li>
<li>We will respond to proposals by August 17th.</li>
<li>Draft copy of the slides for the papers must be submitted by September 14, 2010.</li>
<li>Final submissions are due by October 5th.<br>Please review the speaker guidelines on the web site, <a href="http://rochestersecurity.org/guidelines.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://rochestersecurity.org/guidelines.html</a> before submitting a proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals may be submitted via e-mail to (present2010 at rochestersecurity.org) or by using the on-line submission form at <a href="http://rochestersecurity.org/presentation.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://rochestersecurity.org/presentation.html</a>.</p>
<p>Summit attendees are a mix of technical security professionals, vendors, programmers, web application developers, security testers, students, network administrators and IT executives. Preference will be given to speakers who can present innovative technical content to a broad technical audience. Of course, all presentations are expected to challenge the brightest and quickest of attendees.</p>
<p>The Rochester Security Summit is not a vendor fest. There is zero tolerance for heavy commercial content in presentations. Presenters are expected to avoid any marketing that is not immediately backed up with rationale for its inclusion.</p>
<p>Proposals should consist of the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Presenter and contact info (country of origin and residence-mail, postal address, phone, fax).</li>
<li>Employer and/or affiliations.</li>
<li>Brief biography, list of publications and papers.</li>
<li>Any significant presentation and educational experience/background.</li>
<li>Topic synopsis, proposed paper title, and a one paragraph description.</li>
<li>Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an important tutorial.</li>
<li>Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines ready.</li>
<li>Will you have full text available or only slides?</li>
<li>Please list any other publications or conferences where this material has been or will be published or submitted.</li>
<li>If you think a second 50-minute block will be required to do your topic justice, please let us know and give a rationale for the longer format.<br>Please include the plain text version of this information in your email as well as any file, pdf, sxw, ppt, or html attachments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please forward the above information to</p>
<ul>
