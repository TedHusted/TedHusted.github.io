The free service makes it easy for people to post a micro-blog in 140 characters or less that can be read by anyone who cares to follow along. The Twitter cachet went over the top on 24 Feb 2009 when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/24/AR2009022403424.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Congress posted back-channel tweets during President Obama’s speech</a>. Twitter has been careening toward the populist gutter ever since, until today, the coolness of tweeting rivals sweater vests and baseball caps.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Twitter is the most ironic, moronic waste of time since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit" title="Trivial Pursuit" target="_blank" rel="external">Trivial Pursuit</a>. Twitter not only pursues trivia, it runs it over, backs up, and runs over it again. Even at 140 characters or less, Twitter is the biggest bandwidth boondoggle since <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2008/09/23/rolling-stone-throbs-hate-palin-american-people" title="Sarah Palin" target="_blank" rel="external">Sarah Palin’s stump speeches</a>. Twitter exposes a new depth of gibber-jabber that should bore to tears even the people gibbering the jabber.</div><br><div></div><br><div>My favorite irony is O’Reilly’s plans for a <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596802813/" title="Twitter book" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter book</a>. Besides the incongruity of a 280+ page book about 140- character micro blogging system, Publisher <a href="http://twitter.com/timoreilly" title="Tim O" target="_blank" rel="external">Tim O’Reilly</a> is one of the world’s worst Twitterer. O’Reilly approaches Twitter like James Joyce approached Ulysses – Stream of conciseness. (Sic.) No filter. No ID. On my screen, out the door. Hour by harrowing hour. All trees, no forest. Hint@Tim: More is not more.</div><br><div>My favorite feed used to be <a href="http://twitter.com/cwalken" title="Chris Walken" target="_blank" rel="external">Chris Walken</a>. Sadly, the person writing it was <a href="http://jezebel.com/5186944/say-it-aint-so-fiddy-celebs-let-non+celebs-ghost+write-their-twitters" target="_blank" rel="external">not actually the actor</a> Christopher Walken, and Twitter censored the feed … weeding orchids and fertilizing dandelions.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Of course, Twitter doesn’t have to be mindless. It could be a cool technology again … if more people would stop tweeting like they were talking to the family parakeet. (“That’s a pretty girl. Polly wanna cracker?”)</div><br><div></div><br><div>Truth be told, I’ve enjoyed tweets from friends doing even mildly interesting things. (I’m looking at you, @Schwebbie!) But, bandwidth is bandwidth, and people with nothing to say, shouldn’t say it over Twitter. Reporting from the back of the Emperor’s closet, here’s some easy tweeting guidelines:</div><br><div></div><br><div>What to tweet:</div>

<ul>
<li>Accepted a proposal.</li>
<li>Finished a book.</li>
<li><p>Bought a car.</p>
<div>What not to tweet:</div>
</li>
<li><p>Good meeting!</p>
</li>
<li>Yummy lunch!</li>
<li><p>Huge dump!</p>
<div>Or, for the ADD enabled, the micro-version:</div>
</li>
<li><p>What to tweet: Milestones.</p>
</li>
<li>What not to tweet: Minutia.<div>

</div></li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, it’s not just the people using Twitter. As a web application, Twitter sucks eggs. It does one thing, and does it poorly. Given a robust and featureful platform, we might attract a better class of twit.</p>
<p>Happily, third parties are busily writing <a href="http://twitter.com/downloads" title="improved Twitter clients" target="_blank" rel="external">improved Twitter clients</a> and <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/twitterapps" title="applications" target="_blank" rel="external">applications</a>, but that doesn’t excuse Twitter’s own lack of innovation. (Or <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10084487-2.html?tag=mncol;txt" title="inability to pick a business model" target="_blank" rel="external">inability to pick a business model</a> to fund innovation.)</p>
<p>Here’s the ten most obvious features that a competent micro-blogging network should offer out-of-the-box (most of which have already been invented):</p>
<p>9. Twits often use tweets as polls, but we have to tabulate the votes by hand (<a href="http://strawpollnow.com/" title="StrawPollNow" target="_blank" rel="external">StrawPollNow</a>).</p>
<p>8. Twitter is a micro-blog, and people also have regular blogs, but we have to post our own tweet when we post a blog (<a href="http://www.pingtwitter.com/" title="PingTwitter" target="_blank" rel="external">PingTwitter</a>).</p>
<p>7. People post URLs in tweets, but what are the most popular URLs being posted? (<a href="http://www.twitturls.com/" title="TwittURLs" target="_blank" rel="external">TwittURLs</a>)</p>
<p>6. Twits have followers, which follow other twits, but Twitter doesn’t recommend which twits we should be following (<a href="http://www.crazybob.org/twubble/" title="Twubble" target="_blank" rel="external">Twubble</a>).</p>
<p>5. Twits like to follow their own followers, but Twitter doesn’t have an autofollow feature (<a href="http://tweetbots.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">TweetBots</a>).</p>
<p>4. People like to re-tweet, but there’s no re-tweet feature, and no handy list of tweets most re-tweeted. (Can you dig it?) (<a href="http://www.retweetrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ReTweetRank</span></a>)</p>
<p>3. We can mark tweets as favorites, but where’s the list of the most favored tweets on the network?</p>
<p>2. The tweet feed is an generic chronology. Where are the categories? The personas? The tags? The Web 2.0? (<a href="http://twemes.com/" title="Twemes" target="_blank" rel="external">Twemes</a>)</p>
<p>1. The platform is so <em><span style="font-weight:bold;">not</span></em> scalable that people have time to get a “<a href="http://mashable.com/2009/02/26/twitter-fail-whale-tattoo/" title="Twitter is Busy" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter is Busy</a>“ tattoo waiting for it come back online.</p>
<p>My prediction for 2010? Twitter becomes MySpace so-yesterday, and a new site with a reasonable feature set becomes the next socially transmitted dementia.</p>

<div><br><br>As a <a href="http://theiiba.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">business analyst</a>, I spend my work days crafting requirements for web applications, which include wireframes that illustrate the page layouts. Web site wireframes are blue prints that define a page’s content and functionality, without conveying design elements, like colors, graphics, or fonts.<br><br></div><br><div><br><br>Since wireframes are one of my key deliverables, I’ve tried a number of different tools, including <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Visio</a>, <a href="http://www.smartdraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">SmartDraw</a>, <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Balsmiq</a>, and <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2009/03/drawing-on-your-creativity-in-docs.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Docs Drawings</a>. For web site wireframes, my hands-down, indispensable, favorite tool-of-choice is <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gliffy</a>.<br><br>Here’s why:<br><br></div>

<ol>
<li>Gliffy is a visual tool fluent in pixels. I can drag and drop shapes in Gliffy to my heart’s content, but I can also specify the precise pixel dimensions, and position shapes at exact positions on the page. Most other tools force you to drag everything into place by hand – which is like flying an airplane without an altimeter!</li>
<li>Gliffy exports drawings to standard formats, like JPEG, PNG, and SVG (Visio). It’s easy to paste Gliffy images into Word docs or insert them into Google Docs.</li>
<li>Gliffy is cloud-based. I can use Gliffy anywhere there’s an Internet connection and a browser. It also works great with Chrome!</li>
<li>Gliffy is reliable and well-supported. After several weeks of hard use, I’ve had exactly one functional issue with Gliffy. I filed a ticket, and an hour later my problem was solved.</li>
<li>Gliffy stores drawings in easy to manage folders, and files that are quick to load, and easy to share.</li>
<li>Gliffy is inexpensive … starting with free. A free account has the same utility as a paid account, but imprints your drawings with a “Powered by Gliffy” advertisement. The paid accounts start a $5 a month for one user, or $25 a month for ten users.<div>(Did I mention that Gliffy lets you specify shapes in pixels?)</div><br><div></div><br><div>The next time you need to whip up a wireframe or UI mockup, do yourself a favor and take <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gliffy</a> for a spin.</div><br><div></div><br><div>(Did I mention it was free?)</div><br><div></div><br><div>See Also: <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/features/20-steps-to-better-wireframing/" target="_blank" rel="external">20 Steps to Better Wireframing</a>.</div></li>

        <p><span style="font-size:180%;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/f4a79-checkvist.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/f4a79-checkvist.png?w=300" alt=""></a>There’s no shortage of online TODO list managers: <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Remember the Milk</a>, <a href="http://todoist.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Todoist</a>, <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Toodled</a>, just to name a few. A new offering, <a href="http://checkvist.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">CheckVist</a>, brings a second dimension to TODOology: keyboard-friendly outlining.</p>
<p>CheckVist bills itself as an “online collaborative outliner and task list manager”. The bullet points include</p>
<ul>
<li>Jot it down fast with keyboard shortcuts to speed data-entry</li>
<li>Exchange data with other applications through import and export</li>
<li>Refine tasks with unlimited outline levels and multiple checklists</li>
<li>Work with others by sharing checklists and enabling change notification<br>CheckVist is not as feature-rich as similar products, but for brainstorming and outlining, there’s something to be said for a clutter-free interface. While CheckVist supports the notion of “todo”s, it’s really about organizing chunks of information in to a hierarchical list, often with a group of collaborators, not about personal time and deadline management. As a result, CheckVist a great complement to other, more complicated products.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">How fast is data entry?</span></p>
<p>My favorite CheckVist feature is that it’s intuitive (err, “familiar”) to use. Common outlining keyboard shortcuts, like tab and shift-tab work as expected. Items can be moved up and down with the Ctrl+Arrow keys. The UI is geared to multiple lists, making it easy to get in and out of different lists that you may maintain for different project.</p>
<p>The CheckVist UI doesn’t make you think, making it a great product for brainstorming.<br><span style="font-size:130%;"><br>Does CheckVist work with other applications?</span></p>
<p>My second favorite feature is the easy and elegant way CheckVist imports and exports data. Several convenient formats are supported, including plain test (tabs), Atlassian Confluence format (wiki), OPML format (Mac), and HTML format. When exporting, you can include or exclude notes, status, and change details.</p>
<p>For super-fast data-entry, my favorite approach is to whip up a tab-based outline in a programmer’s editor, and then import it to CheckVist for refinement. If you need to include an outline in a Word document, it’s very easy to export it as plain text, paste it into Word, and convert your outline to a bulleted list with just a click or three.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to copy checklists, either by using the built-in copy feature, or by exporting a checklist and importing it again later. If you have large project checklists that you use over and over again: here’s your sign!</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Are large checklists easy to manage?</span></p>
<p>CheckVist seems geared for larger projects. I’ve several outlines working (in my free account), some of which with well over a hundred items, and it hasn’t skipped a beat. Since, it’s a snap to open and close the outline items, it’s easy to get the big picture, and then drill down to the fine detail.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Can multiple authors edit a checklist?</span></p>
<p>Since CheckVist is primarily a brainstorming product, collaboration is a key use case. It’s easy to add additional authors to any of your CheckVists. As the original owner, you can always unshare the list with any of the other authors.</p>
<p>To help grease the rails of collaboration, CheckVist tracks of who edited a task, and can alert you whenever an update occurs.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Is “alpha” software safe to use?</span></p>
<p>Right now, CheckVist is labelled “alpha” software by its authors, and it’s only been in public use since August 2008. CheckVist has a very solid, professional feel to it, and I have no qualms about using it myself. Though, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>There are some glitches, mainly around latency when editing. Sometimes when I’m rewriting a task, the changes won’t display correctly while I’m making the change. But, as soon as it is saved, the task displays correctly.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I’ve had is with trying use the “undo” feature. Bluntly, CheckVist undo (as of this writing) is not ready for primetime. The feature tends to undo more than you would expect, and if you use it, you’ll probably regret it. Of course, if you’re used to using ctrl-z in other products, undo can be a hard habit to unlearn :(</p>
<p>Overall, I’ve been using it hard, and the only data I’ve lost was due to undo. Everyone has to decide for his or herself how scary is an “alpha” tag.<br><span style="font-size:130%;"><br>Who makes CheckVist?</span></p>
<p>If you are use of any of the fine JetBrains products, like IDEA or Resharper, you would take comfort in the knowledge that CheckVist is brought to us by two TeamCity developers, . According to the website, “”.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Is CheckVist right for me?</span></p>
<p>If you are looking for a decent online outlining tool, to use for checklists or brainstorming, then definitely take CheckVist for a spin. It may not replace your TODO list manager, but you might also get more done. :)</p>
<p>HTH, Ted.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/fa129-junglebook.png" alt=""></a>My wife’s most precious Christmas gift was also the least expensive: the $4 a year we’re paying Amazon to backup two gigabytpes of digitial memories of Christmas past.</p>
<p>Despite the backup CDs, and backup USB drive, she still worried that our digital photos would one day turn up missing. A few days before Christmas, a friend turned me onto Jungle Disk, an Amazon S3 application.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jungle Disk</a> makes using the Amazon cloud as easy as using a local disk drive. Simply install the client software (for Windows, Mac, or Linux) on your computer, like any other application. Sign up for an Amazon S3 account, and suddenly, you can backup up anything you like to the Amazon cloud.</p>
<p>What’s the cloud? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank" rel="external">Technically</a>, cloud computing is “An emerging computing paradigm where data and services reside in massively scalable data centers and can be ubiquitously accessed from any connected devices over the internet.” Colloquially, it’s using the web like a computer peripheral.</p>
<p>Raw storage on the Amazon cloud starts at $0.15 a gigabtye a month ($1.80 a year). The rate compares well to applications like Google Picasa. A free Picasa account comes with 1 GB of storage. For $20 a year, Google gives you 10 GB more. If we did need 10 GB of A3 storage, we’d be paying $18 a year. Meanwhile, Yahoo’s Flckr gives .1 GB (100 MB) to free accounts, and offers unlimited storage for $25 a year.</p>
<p>Of course, Jungle Disk and Flckr are very different applications. JD lets you backup or store any kind of file, just like it was a remote network drive. Flckr is restricted to photos, but lets you share those photos with anyone you like (in strange and marvelous ways).</p>
<p>There are two primary ways of using the Jungle Disk Desktop Edition– you can choose to use one or both of these options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The second option for using Jungle Disk is the automatic backup feature. The Automatic Backup feature allows you to keep files and folders on your local machine backed up automatically off-site to your Jungle Disk. If you mainly want to use your online storage space for backup, the Automatic Backup feature makes it easy and eliminates the need to copy files to your mapped drive manually on a regular basis or use 3rd party backup software. Once backed up with Automatic Backup, your files will also be available via the mapped drive.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily open or copy backed up files from your mapped drive back to your local machine. If you need to restore a large number of files to your machine you can also use the built-in Restore feature that allows you to select a large number of files and directories and restore them in a single operation. The restore feature also allows you to restore previous versions of files, which are stored in a special directory on your Jungle Disk.</p>
<p>JD does come with some startup costs. In addition to the storage costs, a small charge applies to every data transfer. Usually, the transfer fee is lost in the rounding, but if you upload several gig, it could add up to folding money. In my case, the first month’s bill from Amazon totaled a whopping thirty-two cents for uploading and storing 1.5 GB. Even better, I setup S3 to use my existing Amazon.com account, leaving me one less login to manage.</p>
<p>The only bump so far is that the Windows backup doesn’t run if the user is logged out. One workaround is to set the backup to try again as soon as it can. Then, the next time that login is used, the backup will launch. If you’re using incremental backup, it won’t be a noticeable performance hit.</p>
<p>Note that there’s a one time $20 charge for the JD client software. But, it’s a double saw buck well spent. Jungle Disk is quick and easy to use. The user interface is clean, and it’s very easy to indicate what files to backup, and how often to refresh the backup.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Jungle!</p>

        <p><a href="http://google.com/a/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/20915-googleyeyes.png" alt=""></a>In a prior blog, I overview moving a personal site to Google Apps. Before taking the leap yourself, here’s a grab bag of gotcha’s and pleasant surprises.</p>
<p>Googley gotcha’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you do need a domain. :)</li>
<li>During the initial setup, I inadverently closed my Google Apps window while entering the CNAME changes. Eventually, I went back to , I was able to pickup where I left off. (The “a” is for “apps” – Google likes to use one-letter IDs when it can.)</li>
<li>The Mail and Chat services weren’t enabled by default. To enable additional services, look for the “Add more services” link hidden next to the Service Center heading.</li>
<li>Transferring the MX registration can take 24-48 hours, depending on your timing and your registrar.</li>
<li>The Google App accounts have their own login area . Trying to login using your domain at the standard account prompt won’t work.</li>
<li>Along the same vein, the Google Apps Account is separate from a regular Google Account. To access all that Google has to offer, you need both. (Happily, the cookies don’t conflict, and you can be logged into both accounts at once.)</li>
<li>The applications are useful and usable, but not truly ready for prime time, when compared to conventional suites, like OpenOffice, or Microsoft Office. The Sites can be especially frustrating. (Can you say “GeoCities”?)</li>
<li>While GA “Starter Pages”, iGoogle, and Blogger, all seem to utilize the same “Gadget” plugins, they seem to be using different code bases. It would be great if there were all shared between the three platforms.</li>
<li>The starter pages can be configured by anonymous users. Once a user has configured a start page, the administrator can’t push start page changes. (So, an anonymous start page isn’t a good fit as the domain welcome page.)</li>
<li>If you delete a page in a Google site, you can’t reuse the name. The site will stubbornly append a numeral to the end, so instead of having a new “Welcome” page, you end up with “Welcome2”.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Google Documents (which is different than a Google Site) don’t expose a shared folder structure. You can setup your own folders to organize documents, but no one else will see those folders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Calendar’s “Find Next Available Time” feature can be set to search only “Working Hours”, but you can’t configure the working hour span (it’s 8a to 6p, M-F, like it or not!).</li>
<li><p>Not all Google assets play well together. For example, I tend to draft blogs in Google Notebook first. Pasting directly from Notebook to Blogger generates some ugly HTML. I have sanitize the copy first by pasting from Notebook to Notepad to Blogger.<br>And some pleasant surprises:</p>
</li>
<li><p>While some application features are missing, and performance can be choppy, the collaboration features help pick up the slack.</p>
</li>
<li>If you source a new domain through a Google Apps vendor, the domain setup is pre-configured.</li>
<li>The Standard Version starts out with 200 user ceiling, and you can ask for more.</li>
<li>Any user can be deputised as an Administrator.</li>
<li>You can create additional CNAME records for quick access to different services, like calendar.yourdomain.com.</li>
<li>You can map Sites to addresses under your domain, so that the clumsy Google Apps link is not shown.</li>
<li>Gmail now lets you import mail (new or old) from other GMail accounts using POP (in case you already got one).</li>
<li>The Apps allow some quick-and-easy color and logo customiizations.</li>
<li>Individual assets can be shared with Google Accounts outside your domain (if the administrator doesn’t disable external sharing).</li>
<li>GMail handles rich text quite well, so you can paste a table from Word into an email.</li>
<li>The Calendar is easy to share with people outside your domain, like contractors.</li>
<li>The Premium Accounts ($50/user/year) also have access to free video conferencing!<br>And, of course, everyone in your domain still has access to all the other Google goodies, like Notebook, Blogger, Knol, and more .</li>
</ul>
<p>HTH, Ted.</p>
