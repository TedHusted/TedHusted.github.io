        <p>Like most developers of a certain age, I’m a latecomer to Ajax. We’ve adopted it whole-heartedly for my current project, so I’ll be passing along my own spin on the learning curve.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I snagged a copy of “<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5208774" target="_blank" rel="external">Teach Yourself AJAX in 10 minutes</a>“, which is actually quite good. But the notion that you can do the “chapters” in 10 minutes is a bit far fetched. (Ditto for the “24-hour” books. Most chapters seem to take me 90 minutes to two hours. Maybe I’m slow.)</p>
<p>Last week, I stumbled on a <a href="http://www.ebook.gen.tr/ajax/Professional%20Ajax%20Php.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">PDF</a> of the first edition of Ajax Professional. The second edition is<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0470109491/husteddotcom-20" target="_blank" rel="external"><br>hot-off-the-presses</a>, but I haven’t had a chance to pick it up yet.</p>
<p>In the first edition, I was hoping the example application (Chapter 9) would contrast conventional versus event-driven programming, but it seemed to spend more time with the routine guts of the application, rather than the interesting Ajax bits.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 lays a good foundation for Ajax development. Most of Chapter 2, we are handling with frameworks, but it does make one appreciate how much YUI/Dojo and Jayrock do for us, given that with Jayrock we are boiling the Ajax calls down to</p>
<p><pre>   PhoneBook.rpc.entry_list(entryTableLoad).call(channel);</pre><br>Chapter 3 describes several patterns, most or all of which will apply<br>to my current project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Predictive Fetch</li>
<li>Incremental Field Validation</li>
<li>Multi-Stage Download</li>
<li>Try Again</li>
<li>Submission Throttling</li>
<li>Periodic Refresh (“Polling”)</li>
<li>Cancel Pending Requests<br>Another chapter provides a gentle introduction to <a href="http://json.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">JSON</a>, though I think we have a handle on that now. Since JSON is the constant notation for<br>JavaScript, I’m finding that it’s also handy for creating test data.<br>We could even create an mock RPC script for database-free testing (see<br>Anvil Issue 16).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://yuiblog.com/assets/proajax.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">An excerpt from the second edition is online now.</a> It’s a section from Chapter 4, “Ajax Libraries” that covers the YUI Connection Manager. The second edition adds chapters on Ajax Libraries, Request Management, Mpas and Mashups, Ajax Debugging Tools, Ajax Frameworks (including Atlas), and a .NET case study. So, I’ll probably have to get it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.crockford.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Douglas Crockford’s Wrrrld Wide Web” site</a> is a menagerie of groovy links. (Crockford being responsible for the notion of JSON and JSON-RPC.) I’ve only pursued a few, but I’m sure to be back.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.javascriptlint.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript Lint</a> is a “must-have”. It saved me several minutes of debugging the first time I used it.</p>
<p>So as to not let the tools have all the fun, I ordered a copy<br>of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596101996/husteddotcom-20" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</a>“ through the link on Crockford’s<br>site. (My pidgin JS is beginning to show!)</p>
<p>Speaking of tools, I wasn’t thrilled with what <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/" target="_blank" rel="external">HMTL Tidy</a> does with the JS script<br>elements. It wraps the script element but doesn’t indent the closing tag, leaving the markup looking like a awkward hanging indent. Since our HTML files are heavy with script includes, I’d rather not use Tidy as a formatter. But, it still works well for validation. (As does The HTML Validator for FireFox.)</p>
<p>OTOH, I am thrilled to be back in a place where we can expect the pages to validate with HTML Tidy!</p>
<p>I’m sure Ajax will be another long strange trip, but at least the path is well-traveled. I’m looking forward to sharing the ride.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>After two years of bashing our brains against ASP.NET at my day job, we’re diving into Ajax for our next frontend.</p>
<p>We looked at Microsoft’s AJAX.NET, and at Anthem, and GWT, and Dojo, and we settled on the Yahoo User Interface Library. Out of the box, the widgets aren’t as sexy as some others, but the library is well documented, easy enough to use, and Yahoo seems committed to supporting YUI over the long haul. (I haven’t run any benchmarks, but it also seems like its the fastest.)</p>
<p>Of course, I’m also liking that Yahoo <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/02/20/yui-220-released/" target="_blank" rel="external">eats their own dog food</a> … “the YUI you can download here is exactly the same YUI Library used all across Yahoo!”.</p>
<p>Though, it’s not YUI that’s really making the move from ASPX to HTML-and-Ajax possible for us. The “reality check” kudos go to a .NET JSON-RPC libary named “Jayrock”. Using <a href="http://jayrock.berlios.de/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jayrock</a>, we are able to create a paper-thin ASHX handler (“servlet”) that calls our business logic framework (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/anvil/" target="_blank" rel="external">Anvil</a>).</p>
<p>From a coding perspective, the handler is a “plain-old” C# class with some annotations to enable the JSON-RPC voodoo.</p>
<p><pre>[JsonRpcMethod]<br> public AppEntry entry(string key)<br> {<br>    // … arbitrary business logic to obtain a value object (JavaBean)<br>    return appEntry;<br>}</pre><br>On the JavaScript side, Jayrock bundles a utility script that generates the JSON API gluecode for us. In the end, we can just call a method on the handler and pass in our parameters and a callback function. Click. Done. Sweet.</p>
<p><pre>  PhoneBook.rpc.entry(entry_key,onEdit_load).call(av_channel);</pre><br>If anything does go sour, the handler can throw an exception, which, on the JavaScript side, is automatically routed to a separate error callback. Once there, it’s trivial to display the message, and even the stack trace, if we want it.</p>
<p>Happily, we are already doing all the data conversion and formatting on the business logic layer, so for Ajax, we are good to go.</p>
<p>We did an initial “spike” using Dojo and our canonical example application (a simple PhoneBook). We then did the same thing with YUI. A keen happenstance was that we were able to use Jayrock to switch “channels” behind the scenes, so that the application could connect to the server using Dojo or using YUI, just by changing one line of code.</p>
<p>Along with the clear separation of concerns, I think what we like most about Ajax is that it plays well with others. We can start with YUI as a foundation, but if we want to toss in some <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dojo</a> or <a href="http://www.yui-ext.com/deploy/yui-ext/docs/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ext</a> widgets, we can. No sweat.</p>
<p>I’m thinking this feeling is what JetBrains means by “Develop with pleasure!” :)</p>

        <p>I’m now the proud caretaker of two different Google Code projects.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/anvil/" target="_blank" rel="external">Anvil</a> is a business logic framework based on the context and chain of command patterns. The Anvil core is a port of the Jakarta Commons Chain of Responsibility, used by Struts 1.3. It’s available for C# now. We use Spring.NET for the object factory, and iBATIS.NET for data access (so this would be an easy port back to Java). Anvil is still way under-documented, but it works well for us. Best of all, Anvil made the transition to Ajax without missing a beat.</p>
<p>When we created Anvil, our original goal was to keep as much code as possible out of the ASPX pages and code-behinds, including validation and formatting. As it turns out, that same goal makes the framework an ideal backend to Ajax pages.</p>
<p>The other new project is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sq1-struts2/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apache Struts from Square One</a>, which hosts materials used by my training course including slide presentations, coding exercises, and a companion textbook. The text is new, but the slides and other materials have been available at the <a href="http://www.strutsuniversity.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Struts University</a> site for some time.</p>
<p>The course is something I’ve been creating through successive refinement. When Struts first came out, people asked me to come in for “Train the Trainer” sessions, where consultants wanted to learn Struts so they could teach it to their clients and other consultants. Then, it was direct requests from development teams who wanted to jumpstart a new project using Struts. By the time Struts 1.2 came around, people were asking me to come in and review what they’ve been doing in Struts, to see if they were on the right track.</p>
<p><a href="http://husted.com/ted/vita.html" target="_blank" rel="external">On each trip</a>, I’d create a new session or improve an old session, and eventually it all evolved into a course based on the Struts MailReader application. The course has now made the jump to Struts 2, and I’m working on a companion text to the original training materials, which I might offer through <a href="http://lulu.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">LuLu</a> when it’s “ready for primetime”.</p>
<p>An early and incomplete draft of Part 1 of the book (‘Carpe Diem’) is available for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49385&amp;package_id=223769&amp;release_id=490486" target="_blank" rel="external">download</a>. The complete set of slides and other materials are available through the <a href="http://www.strutsuniversity.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Struts University site</a>. There’s even a new <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sq1-struts2" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Group</a> for questions and feedback.</p>
<p>Of course, although the text is a work in progress, the live course is complete, and I’ve presented it several times. Drop by <a href="http://www.strutsmentor.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Struts Mentor</a> for more about the live course.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the Google Code ninjas who are making project hosting possible for grunts like me. There are rough edges still, but I can see where Google Code is going, and I’m happy to tag along for the ride.</p>

        <p>I may be late to the dance, but, let me cut in and whisper in your ear: “Struts 2.0.6 is General Availability.” How’s that for a sweet something?</p>
<p>The GA vote went down just over a week ago, on 22 February 2007. In retrospect, the Struts 2.0.1 release was also ready for primetime. Many people have been joyfully using 2.0.1 in production since September. The holdup was that our major dependency, XWork 2, stubbornly clung to beta status from September to January. The actual code was fine, but the XWork committers wanted to spruce up the documentation and did not want to stamp the distribution “final” yet. Since then, the XWork group has changed to a milestone release system, as Struts uses. Now, we can grade both Struts and XWork releases based on experience rather than expectation.</p>
<p>Whilst XWork 2 twiddled with documentation, Struts 2 did not stand still. Struts 2.0.6 boasts several new heavyweight features, like plugins and a zero-configuration approach (Yes, Virginia, there is no XML!). We even moved the internal dependency injection over to Crazy Bob Lee’s new secret project, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Guice</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, by “we”, I mean our star committer Don Brown. We were going to hold off on some of these changes until after our first GA, but as an expectant father, Don was worried that the bundle of joy would cut into his committing time. So, Don managed to put aside his Nintendo Wii long enough to commit a stunning array of new features. For more about the many joyful features of Struts 2.0.6, pop by the <a href="http://struts.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apache Struts website</a>.</p>
<p>But, wait, there’s more! The Struts 2.0.7 release might be available next week. No earthshaking new features, just the usual successive refinements and odd code fix. Of course, it will be a drop-in binary replacement for Struts 2.0.6, so there’s no reason to wait!</p>
<p>For Struts 2.1.x, we planning to migrate both the portlet support and the Ajax/Dojo tags to plugins. Since we’re now using the Yahoo User Interface Library (YUI) at work, I’m also thinking we might be able to offer a Ajax/YUI plugin too. But, that’s another post. :)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Struts 1.3.x is ramping up for another release, and there’s continued talk of a Struts 1.4. Test builds for Struts 1.3.7 are available, and a 1.3.8 build should follow on its heels to correct an oversight with Action redirects.</p>
<p>As always, the best is yet to come!</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><strong>Is there a standard Java web framework?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Sun has added JavaServer Faces to its<br><a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/" target="_blank" rel="external">Java Enterprise Edition</a>, which includes other goodies like JavaServer Pages and the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library. If you grab the distribution that bundles the NetBeans IDE, Java has finally become a one-stop shop!</p>
<p><strong>Is JSF a specification, like JSP and JSTL?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Sun provides its own Reference Implementation, but other people can provide their own implementation of the specification.</p>
<p><strong>Is anyone doing that? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Apache Software Foundation offers the <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apache MyFaces</a> JSF implementation that you can use instead of the Sun RI. Along with a certified JSF implementation, the MyFaces project also offers a number of additional JSF components. Standard JSF components include gizmos like a DataGrid. Additional components include goodies like tabbed panels, various tree views, HTML editors, scrollers, and such, that you can drop into your application. If you are just getting started with JSF, the MyFaces mailing list provides a lot of friendly, free support.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other JSF component libraries available? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. For example, Oracle offers ADF. In fact, Oracle donated the better part of its ADF component library to the ASF some time ago. It’s slowly becoming part of MyFaces under the name Trinidad.</p>
<p><strong>What about AJAX? </strong></p>
<p>People are trying various approaches toward integrating AJAX with JSF components. Some AJAX frameworks for JSF are already available, including <a href="https://ajax4jsf.dev.java.net/nonav/ajax/ajax-jsf/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ajax4jsf</a>. Generally, you can use AJAX frameworks with the Sun RI or MyFaces, as you prefer.</p>
<p>This is the same sort of approach that Microsoft is taking for its ASP.NET framework (which is similar to JSF). To leverage AJAX, Microsoft is building a second framework, Atlas, on top of ASP.NET.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other JSF frameworks? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. The <a href="http://shale.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apache Shale framework</a> extends JSF to add advanced features, many of which are designed to woo Java web developers used to Action-based frameworks, like Struts.</p>
<p><strong>What’s happening with Struts? </strong></p>
<p>By any measure, Apache Struts is still the most popular Java web framework. Last year, Struts merged with another web development community, WebWork, to create a new version of Struts. <a href="http://struts.apache.org/2.x/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apache Struts 2</a> is in beta release now.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any comparisons of the JSF and Struts 2 feature sets? </strong></p>
<p>In practice, comparing JSF and Struts 2 is less about the features and more about the development paradigms. The reason we have these two frameworks is because each solution approaches the web development problem from a different perspective.</p>
<p>The implicit goal of JSF-style component-based development is to make web development more like conventional desktop/GUI development. The implicit goal of Action-based development is to streamline web development and make the best of the web platform. If a team likes the idea of creating web applications as if they were desktop applications, then platforms like JSF and ASP.NET are the way to go. If a team is ready to embrace the web for what it is, then platforms like Struts, Ruby, PHP, and so forth, are still the way to go.</p>
<p>In other words, it all depends on the problem we are trying to solve. If the problem is that web development is unlike conventional GUI development, then the component model is a valid solution. If the problem is that web development lacks an elegant and extensible infrastructure, then the action model is a valid solution.</p>
<p><strong>But can’t we create a framework that resembles GUI development but provides a simple, web-savy infrastructure?</strong></p>
<p>Possibly, but that would be the web equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_unified_field_theory" target="_blank" rel="external">unified field theory</a>. Today, in physics, and in web development, we have two models that are each used for different reasons, but, side by side, the two are wildly incompatible.</p>
<p>In physics, it boils down to “little” or “big”? In web development, it boils down to “GUI Desktop” or “Enterprise Web”?</p>
<p>Pick your poison!</p>
