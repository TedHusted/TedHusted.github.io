        <p>(Google has made a limited number of development accounts available for a preview of its forthcoming “Wave” product. <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/wavesignup/" target="_blank" rel="external">If you get yours</a>, look me up. I’m ted.husted@wavesandbox.com.)</p>
<p>A few years back, when I first tried <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">IntelliJ IDEA</a>‘s refactoring tools, I felt like I was pair programming with Commander Data. In the background, IDEA would compile my code, correct my syntax, and suggest fixes when my programming got sloppy. IDEA helped me write better code in less time.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog-wave.appspot.com/jaaron" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/29e4c-waveiquette.png" alt=""></a>Being a Camelot of good ideas, <a href="http://tedhusted.blogspot.com/2009/07/fifth-wave-googles-real-time.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Wave</a>, in the guise of robots, includes its own twist on intelligent background agents. Spelly scans input to a wave and corrects spelling errors on the fly (<a href="http://sheenonline.biz/2009/06/12-reasons-why-google-wave-will-change-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="external">using the web as its dictionary</a>). Likewise, Linky scans the wave for text that looks like a hyperlink. If the reference leads to YouTube, Linky will even offer to embed a player into the wave. If language is a barrier to collaboration, Rosy the robot (no joke) will translate a wave into your native language.</p>
<p>To a wave, a robot is just another participant on the wave. A wave is often described as a conversation between participants. (In fact, to use a robot with a wave, you add the robot as a participant.) Just like any other participant, a robot can make real-time changes to the content.</p>
<p>Also like a human participant, a robot can interact with an external system. For example, <a href="http://wavety.com/tweety-google-wave-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tweety </a> can post from a wave to a Twitter account, and <a href="http://wavety.com/bloggy-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bloggy</a> can post a wave to a blog. If any changes are made to the wave, Bloggy will update the blog entry.</p>
<p>Aside from blogs, there are many other systems that a wavebot could update. While Wave has its own version control, a robot could also update an external Subversion repository with all changes made to a wave. Likewise, a robot could create a static HTML page from a wave, so we could edit a wave and automatically update a high-performance website.</p>
<p>Even though Wave is only in developer preview, there are already dozens of robots available, and more are being written every day. (A new website, <a href="http://wavety.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Wavety.com</a>, is already creating a directory of Robots and Gadgets.)</p>
<p>An “interesting” new robot is <a href="http://wavety.com/eliza-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">Eliza the Robot therapist</a>. Eliza scans the wave input looking for chances to reflect. “How do you feel about that?” (Some people are calling Eliza the first spambot!) If you are unsure whether to chat with Eliza, decide with a quick round of <a href="http://wavety.com/roshambo-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">rock/paper/scissors</a><a href="http://wavety.com/roshambo-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">.</a></p>
<p>Already, I am feeling a need for a reverse Turing Test for wave participants – is it live or is it cybernext?</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Press the Button</span></p>
<p>If robots are the workhorses of Wave, gadgets are the showdogs. Gadgets add interactive forms and animations to a wave, imposing focus and structure over participant input. Several gadgets are already available, including Polly, for polls, and Checky, for checklists. The gadget API is compatible with OpenSocial, making a host of existing gizmos available to wave developers.</p>
<p>Of course, the real test of any gadget platform is games. Already, we are seeing several multiplayer games bobbing into waves, including <a href="http://wavety.com/play-chess-gadget/" target="_blank" rel="external">chess </a>and <a href="http://wavety.com/sudoku-gadget/" target="_blank" rel="external">soduko</a>.</p>
<p>Although the full power of Wave is still rising to the surface, it’s easy to see that it will be a powerful platform for project management, content management, intranets, team communication, customer support, and just plain fun.</p>
<p>While we may not be able to use wave as a <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml" target="_blank" rel="external">desert topping or floor wax</a>, with the right robots and gadgets in play, we may be able to use it for everything else.</p>

        <p>At VanDamme Associates (soon to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/VanDammeAssociates#play/all/uploads-all/2/kBuhQsVhEU8" target="_blank" rel="external">fka VA</a>), we like our social media. Besides being blogging and Twitter fanatics, we integrate websites and Association Management Systems with various social media platforms, including ThePort, Go Lightly, and our own Ektron Group Application.</p>
<p>An up and coming player on the social media horizon is Google Wave. Although it is not available to the public now, Google announced a developers version at Google IO on May 28. Google Wave is presented as an open-source, real-time communication platform, combining elements of email, instant messaging, wikis, web chat, social networking, and project management. Google Wave looks to be an elegant, in-browser communication client that anyone can use to bring together a group of friends or business partners. The group following the wave can discuss topics and share files – in real time, character by character.</p>
<p>Along with the real-time dimensions, Wave is bringing extensibility, embeddability, and sharability to the table. We will be able to embed a Wave in any blog or website, and we can also build widgets or gadgets that utilize Waves. Like today’s wikis and Google Docs, anything written within a Wave can be edited by anyone else.</p>
<p><a href="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/images/ss1.gif" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/images/ss1.gif" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Visually, a Wave resembles a rich, web forum. Appearances aside, there are key differences.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Everything is shared.</span> While some web forms allow for editing of posts, being able to edit everything, wiki-style, is part of the Wave DNA.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Not everyone is human.</span> The environment includes helper robots that access the Wave as if they were collabators. Some of the robots already in service include Debuggy (an in-wave debugger), Stocky (which pulls stock prices based on stock quote mentions), Tweety (the Twave robot, which displays tweets inside of a wave), and Spelly (a natural language spell checker).<span style="font-weight:bold;">Files are first class citizens.</span> While forms and email system often support attachments, we will be able to drag and drop documents and images into a Wave. Within a web, images are presented in albums, sound files can be played, and documents are shared.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Plugins are seamless.</span> Gadget and widgets can be designed to work within a Wave – including rich applications like issue trackers – and other platforms can embed a Wave into a page, much the same way we embed YouTube today, to create, for example, a instant chat room or talk-back channel.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Playback’s a breeze. </span>Wave’s playback feature walks-through how the entire conversation developed from the start, player-piano style, making it to figure out “how we got there from here”. For someone joining a Wave-in-progress, Playback is a great catch-up on the thought process.<br>But, the strangest bit about Wave is that Google is not only enabling collaboration but <span style="font-style:italic;">competition. </span>The “lion’s share” of the product will be available as open source, and there are already basic, non-Google hosted implementations of Wave. Once Wave becomes generally available, companies will be able to install third-party Wave implementations on their own servers and retain control of their own collaborative assets. If a discussion takes place inside a intranet firewall, it can stay within the firewall. (Or, alternatively, just let it ride on the Google cloud.)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, there’s no published schedule indicating when Google Wave will be made available to the public. But, it is real and already available to bleeding edge developers. For more, check the resources section.</p>

        <p>In the third in a series of “talks for smart people”, <a href="http://bluetie.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">BlueTie</a> tonight hosted “To Tweet or Not to Tweet” to an engaged and inquisitive group in Pittsford NY. In fact, if the audience had its way, the talk would have been a hour-long question and answer session.</p>
<p>Some hot-button queries were</p>
<ul>
<li>Why would someone follow over a thousand people?</li>
<li>How do you find people to follow, or people to follow you?</li>
<li>When should I follow, and when should I friend?</li>
<li>Are the social networks converging?</li>
<li>Is privacy an issue? Or a non-issue?</li>
<li>Can Twitter be used a guerrilla marketing tool?</li>
<li>How else can I use Twitter in my business?<br><div style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://ping.fm/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/b5486-ping_fm.png" alt=""></a>In between a battery of of questions, local Twitter guru <a href="http://twitter.com/EmilyCarpenter" target="_blank" rel="external">Emily Carpenter</a> walked us through the basics of <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/husted" target="_blank" rel="external">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=705537703" target="_blank" rel="external">FaceBook</a>, and, especially, <a href="http://twitter.com/tedhusted" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter</a>.</div><br>The Twitter portion of the talk focused on the dizzying number of third-party add-ins. One that caught my eye is <a href="http://ping.fm/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ping.fm</a>. A point of convergence between the social networks is a status message or micro-blog. Ping makes it easy to update your status on one or more networks from a single dashboard. Of course, like most social network applications today, there are missing features, like post-dating messages, but it is still a sweet dashboard. I’ll be trying this one again.</li>
</ul>
<p>As to the Twitter questions, I won’t try to speak for Emily, but here are my own answers.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Why would someone follow over a thousand people? </span></p>
<p>Mainly to get more followers of your own. People often reciprocate: if you follow someone on Twitter, they follow you back. To compensate, Peopleuse third-party Twitter applications to filter out the important feeds or likely tweets.</p>
<p>Personally, I only follow people that I actually want to read regularly. But, I have noticed that following someone usually leads to more follows, even if it’s someone like <a href="http://twitter.com/tonyrobbins" target="_blank" rel="external">@TonyRobbins</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/johntesh" target="_blank" rel="external">@JohnTesh</a>. If you want to be followed, follow someone else.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">How do you find people to follow, or people to follow you?</span></p>
<p>Start by using Twitter’s<a href="http://twitter.com/invitations/find_on_twitter" target="_blank" rel="external"> Find People</a> feature to lookup your friends and colleagues. Look at who they are following for other interesting feeds. Then goto to a site like <a href="http://www.celebritytweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">CelebrityTweet</a> and look for other people that interest you. Also try looking up your favorite authors. (I found <a href="http://twitter.com/StephenRCovey" target="_blank" rel="external">@StevenRCovey</a> that way.)</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">When should I follow, and when should I friend?</span></p>
<p>On Twitter, we follow. On FaceBook, we friend. On LinkedIn, we connect. On Twitter, you can follow anyone who is tweeting things you want to read. On FaceBook, it’s better to friend only people you actually know and trust, especially personal friends that you might join for dinner or drinks. On Linked In, it’s best to connect with professional colleagues that are connected to your career in some way. People that you might interview for or against.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Twitter is that it crosses the line between personal and professional. People expect Twitter to be a mix. Twitter’s a place where you can be a whole person, and not just the work-you or the home-you.</p>
<p>Still, the Internet is forever, so don’t tweet anything you don’t want the grand kids to read, even if they aren’t born yet</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Are the social networks converging?</span></p>
<p>Yes, the network are adopting similar feature sets, and integrators, like Ping.FM, make it easier to reuse content between networks. Someday, there may one be one. But, for now, people tend to use LinkedIn to manage their resume, and FaceBook to manage their social calendar.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Is privacy an issue? Or a non-issue?</span></p>
<p>To older folks (like me), the amount of information teenagers are sharing on social networks is frightening. But, privacy is relative. The key thing to remember is that nothing you share on a social network is private, so don’t say anything you don’t want your mother, kids, or spouse to know. Personally, I hesitate to mention when I will be traveling, or where my kids might be at a certain time. Burglars and stalkers are no strangers to technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Can Twitter be used a guerrilla marketing tool?</span></p>
<p>Absolutely! Just today, SlideShare sent me this email: “We’ve noticed that your slideshow on SlideShare has been getting a LOT of views in the last 24 hours. Great job … you must be doing something right. ;-) Why don’t you tweet or blog this? Use the hashtag #bestofslideshare so we can track the conversation.”</p>
<p>There’s no reason why my SlideShare views should have spiked on Apr 1st. Even though I think it’s a marketing prank, still, I wrote about it. (And, fool me twice, I’m doing it again!)</p>
<p>Another instance is that we have a meeting coming up for the still-forming local chapter of the <a href="http://rochesterny.theiiba.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">International Institute of Business Analysts</a> . To get the word our for our next meeting, one thing we are considering is asking the members to blog and tweet about it.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">How else can I use Twitter in my business?</span></p>
<p>Many people and businesses have Google Alerts in place to search for items of interest. There are Twitter applications that let you do the same thing with Twitter feeds. For example, I mentioned “bikinis” the other day, and suddenly Bikini Beat is a follower. (Don’t ask!)</p>
<p>By proactively searching Twitter for keywords, companies can target consumers or head-off consumer complaints. But, seller beware, in this age of transparency, be upfront and honest. On the Internet, we can Google, but we can’t hide.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Oh, and should you Tweet?</span></p>
<p>If you have to ask, then you should :)</p>
<p>But, only when you have something to say!</p>

The free service makes it easy for people to post a micro-blog in 140 characters or less that can be read by anyone who cares to follow along. The Twitter cachet went over the top on 24 Feb 2009 when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/24/AR2009022403424.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Congress posted back-channel tweets during President Obama’s speech</a>. Twitter has been careening toward the populist gutter ever since, until today, the coolness of tweeting rivals sweater vests and baseball caps.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Twitter is the most ironic, moronic waste of time since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit" title="Trivial Pursuit" target="_blank" rel="external">Trivial Pursuit</a>. Twitter not only pursues trivia, it runs it over, backs up, and runs over it again. Even at 140 characters or less, Twitter is the biggest bandwidth boondoggle since <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2008/09/23/rolling-stone-throbs-hate-palin-american-people" title="Sarah Palin" target="_blank" rel="external">Sarah Palin’s stump speeches</a>. Twitter exposes a new depth of gibber-jabber that should bore to tears even the people gibbering the jabber.</div><br><div></div><br><div>My favorite irony is O’Reilly’s plans for a <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596802813/" title="Twitter book" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter book</a>. Besides the incongruity of a 280+ page book about 140- character micro blogging system, Publisher <a href="http://twitter.com/timoreilly" title="Tim O" target="_blank" rel="external">Tim O’Reilly</a> is one of the world’s worst Twitterer. O’Reilly approaches Twitter like James Joyce approached Ulysses – Stream of conciseness. (Sic.) No filter. No ID. On my screen, out the door. Hour by harrowing hour. All trees, no forest. Hint@Tim: More is not more.</div><br><div>My favorite feed used to be <a href="http://twitter.com/cwalken" title="Chris Walken" target="_blank" rel="external">Chris Walken</a>. Sadly, the person writing it was <a href="http://jezebel.com/5186944/say-it-aint-so-fiddy-celebs-let-non+celebs-ghost+write-their-twitters" target="_blank" rel="external">not actually the actor</a> Christopher Walken, and Twitter censored the feed … weeding orchids and fertilizing dandelions.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Of course, Twitter doesn’t have to be mindless. It could be a cool technology again … if more people would stop tweeting like they were talking to the family parakeet. (“That’s a pretty girl. Polly wanna cracker?”)</div><br><div></div><br><div>Truth be told, I’ve enjoyed tweets from friends doing even mildly interesting things. (I’m looking at you, @Schwebbie!) But, bandwidth is bandwidth, and people with nothing to say, shouldn’t say it over Twitter. Reporting from the back of the Emperor’s closet, here’s some easy tweeting guidelines:</div><br><div></div><br><div>What to tweet:</div>

<ul>
<li>Accepted a proposal.</li>
<li>Finished a book.</li>
<li><p>Bought a car.</p>
<div>What not to tweet:</div>
</li>
<li><p>Good meeting!</p>
</li>
<li>Yummy lunch!</li>
<li><p>Huge dump!</p>
<div>Or, for the ADD enabled, the micro-version:</div>
</li>
<li><p>What to tweet: Milestones.</p>
</li>
<li>What not to tweet: Minutia.<div>

</div></li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, it’s not just the people using Twitter. As a web application, Twitter sucks eggs. It does one thing, and does it poorly. Given a robust and featureful platform, we might attract a better class of twit.</p>
<p>Happily, third parties are busily writing <a href="http://twitter.com/downloads" title="improved Twitter clients" target="_blank" rel="external">improved Twitter clients</a> and <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/twitterapps" title="applications" target="_blank" rel="external">applications</a>, but that doesn’t excuse Twitter’s own lack of innovation. (Or <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10084487-2.html?tag=mncol;txt" title="inability to pick a business model" target="_blank" rel="external">inability to pick a business model</a> to fund innovation.)</p>
<p>Here’s the ten most obvious features that a competent micro-blogging network should offer out-of-the-box (most of which have already been invented):</p>
<p>9. Twits often use tweets as polls, but we have to tabulate the votes by hand (<a href="http://strawpollnow.com/" title="StrawPollNow" target="_blank" rel="external">StrawPollNow</a>).</p>
<p>8. Twitter is a micro-blog, and people also have regular blogs, but we have to post our own tweet when we post a blog (<a href="http://www.pingtwitter.com/" title="PingTwitter" target="_blank" rel="external">PingTwitter</a>).</p>
<p>7. People post URLs in tweets, but what are the most popular URLs being posted? (<a href="http://www.twitturls.com/" title="TwittURLs" target="_blank" rel="external">TwittURLs</a>)</p>
<p>6. Twits have followers, which follow other twits, but Twitter doesn’t recommend which twits we should be following (<a href="http://www.crazybob.org/twubble/" title="Twubble" target="_blank" rel="external">Twubble</a>).</p>
<p>5. Twits like to follow their own followers, but Twitter doesn’t have an autofollow feature (<a href="http://tweetbots.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">TweetBots</a>).</p>
<p>4. People like to re-tweet, but there’s no re-tweet feature, and no handy list of tweets most re-tweeted. (Can you dig it?) (<a href="http://www.retweetrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ReTweetRank</span></a>)</p>
<p>3. We can mark tweets as favorites, but where’s the list of the most favored tweets on the network?</p>
<p>2. The tweet feed is an generic chronology. Where are the categories? The personas? The tags? The Web 2.0? (<a href="http://twemes.com/" title="Twemes" target="_blank" rel="external">Twemes</a>)</p>
<p>1. The platform is so <em><span style="font-weight:bold;">not</span></em> scalable that people have time to get a “<a href="http://mashable.com/2009/02/26/twitter-fail-whale-tattoo/" title="Twitter is Busy" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter is Busy</a>“ tattoo waiting for it come back online.</p>
<p>My prediction for 2010? Twitter becomes MySpace so-yesterday, and a new site with a reasonable feature set becomes the next socially transmitted dementia.</p>

<div><br><br>As a <a href="http://theiiba.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">business analyst</a>, I spend my work days crafting requirements for web applications, which include wireframes that illustrate the page layouts. Web site wireframes are blue prints that define a page’s content and functionality, without conveying design elements, like colors, graphics, or fonts.<br><br></div><br><div><br><br>Since wireframes are one of my key deliverables, I’ve tried a number of different tools, including <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Visio</a>, <a href="http://www.smartdraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">SmartDraw</a>, <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Balsmiq</a>, and <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2009/03/drawing-on-your-creativity-in-docs.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Docs Drawings</a>. For web site wireframes, my hands-down, indispensable, favorite tool-of-choice is <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gliffy</a>.<br><br>Here’s why:<br><br></div>

<ol>
<li>Gliffy is a visual tool fluent in pixels. I can drag and drop shapes in Gliffy to my heart’s content, but I can also specify the precise pixel dimensions, and position shapes at exact positions on the page. Most other tools force you to drag everything into place by hand – which is like flying an airplane without an altimeter!</li>
<li>Gliffy exports drawings to standard formats, like JPEG, PNG, and SVG (Visio). It’s easy to paste Gliffy images into Word docs or insert them into Google Docs.</li>
<li>Gliffy is cloud-based. I can use Gliffy anywhere there’s an Internet connection and a browser. It also works great with Chrome!</li>
<li>Gliffy is reliable and well-supported. After several weeks of hard use, I’ve had exactly one functional issue with Gliffy. I filed a ticket, and an hour later my problem was solved.</li>
<li>Gliffy stores drawings in easy to manage folders, and files that are quick to load, and easy to share.</li>
<li>Gliffy is inexpensive … starting with free. A free account has the same utility as a paid account, but imprints your drawings with a “Powered by Gliffy” advertisement. The paid accounts start a $5 a month for one user, or $25 a month for ten users.<div>(Did I mention that Gliffy lets you specify shapes in pixels?)</div><br><div></div><br><div>The next time you need to whip up a wireframe or UI mockup, do yourself a favor and take <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gliffy</a> for a spin.</div><br><div></div><br><div>(Did I mention it was free?)</div><br><div></div><br><div>See Also: <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/features/20-steps-to-better-wireframing/" target="_blank" rel="external">20 Steps to Better Wireframing</a>.</div></li>
