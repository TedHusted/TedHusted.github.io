        <p><a href="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/296dd-gook.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/296dd-gook.png?w=300" alt=""></a>This holiday season saw a landmark event. High profile companies,<a href="http://www.facebook.com/barbie" target="_blank" rel="external"> like Mattel</a>, posting a Facebook site URL in prime-time advertising. As it turns out, you don’t need to be a big name company to have your own Facebook site. Anyone can do it, it’s free, and it’s simple as pie.</p>
<p>The reason it’s free and easy is that Facebook doesn’t actually host the site. Facebook provides a namepace and an iframe that points to a site you control. The pages are loaded from your server, wrapped in a Facebook pane.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/" target="_blank" rel="external">Facebook JavaScript API</a> that you can use from any site. With the API, you can like pages, authenticate against Facebook, write to your wall, and such. But with a Facebook site, you can do anything that your own website can do.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have a website of your own, you can create a static site using <a href="http://docs.google.com/demo/%20" target="_blank" rel="external">published Google Docs</a>. Just create a document, and share it with the world, and you can wrap a Facebook site around it.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get started.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you don’t have a Google Docs account, you can sign up at <a href="http://docs.google.com/demo/%20" target="_blank" rel="external">http://docs.google.com/demo/ </a>and create a page to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Share </strong>and change the visibility to public</li>
<li>Then <strong>Share </strong>and <strong>Publish </strong>to the Web</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Login to Facebook. (As if you ever logout!)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php" target="_blank" rel="external">Register an App Name with Facebook</a>. (It’s free!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Facebook account name might be a good one for starters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Under<strong> Facebook Integration</strong>, enter your App Name as the as the <strong>Canvas Page</strong>, and your public, published Google Doc page as the <strong>Canvas URL</strong>. . Under <strong>IFrame Size</strong>, select <strong>Auto-Resiz</strong>e.</p>
</li>
<li>Open <u>apps.facebook.com/{Your-Canvas-URL}</u></li>
<li><p>Voila!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the apps isn’t found right away, check the URL, and wait a few minutes for it to propagate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If t still doesn’t show, open <strong>Advanced </strong>in your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Apps Settings</strong></a>, and <strong>Disable</strong> all the options.<br>For more tips about using Google Docs as a Facebook Canvas, see this Metaprime blog - <a href="http://blog.metaprime.at/how-to-build-a-facebook-landing-page-with-google-docs/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://blog.metaprime.at/how-to-build-a-facebook-landing-page-with-google-docs/</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also use a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/ted-husted/" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Site as a Facebook Canvas</a>. Just keep the site layout within a 870px width or a 740px page with a 130px sidebar. (Though, to appease the API, you might have to add an extra “?” at the end of the URL. )</p>
<p>Google Docs and Google Sites are a great way to maintain a static site within Facebook. For some ideas about what you can do with a full web server, visit the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/wwfgiftcenter/" target="_blank" rel="external">World Wildlife Fund Gift Center</a> and the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/showcase/" target="_blank" rel="external">Facebook Platform Showcase</a>. Common Knowlege also has a great webinar on <a href="http://www.commonknow.com/html/rsrcs/webinarrecordings/101117_FacebookApplications/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">Facebook Sites and Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook integration is a great example of how difficult problems can be solved with simple interfaces. Fire up your Facebook account, and give it a try!</p>

        <p>Non-profits come in all shapes and sizes. Two organizations that touch my own life almost daily are LibriVox and WBER.</p>
<p><a href="http://librivox.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/norights-a.png" alt=""></a>Simply put, <a href="http://librivox.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">LibriVox</a> provides free audiobooks from the public domain. Now entering its sixth year, LibriVox volunteers have completed almost 4,000 reading projects. Laid end to end, it would take two and a half years to play to every LibriVox recording.</p>
<p>While you won’t find the latest James Patterson in the LibriVox catalog, you will find immortal classics like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Das Kapital, Don Quixote, Sherlock Holmes, and my new BFF, The Autobiography of Ben Franklin.</p>
<p>LibriVox offers several ways to search for books, including title, author, and genre. If you’re just getting started, <a href="http://librivox.org/newcatalog/genres.php" target="_blank" rel="external">genre is a great way to browse the catalog</a>.</p>
<p>All of the books can be downloaded in MP3 and other formats, making it easy to enjoy the book on any device. I listen to mine on a simple Coby MP3 player that I can use when walking the dog or plug into the auxilliary jack while driving.</p>
<p>Though, I hear that life is more than audio books … there is also music!</p>
<p><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://wber.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://wber.monroe.edu/site/html/themes/BEST/images/logo.jpg" alt=""></a></div><br>Technically, <a href="http://www.wber.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WBER</a> is closer to an .EDU than an .ORG, but as a community-supported radio station, it looks and feels like a non-profit.</p>
<p>Every day, WBER brings its listeners to an eclectic mix of the latest alternative rock, on the Internet as wber.org.and via the Rochester NY airwaves as 90.5.</p>
<p>As part of its educational mission, on weekdays during the school year, WBER turns its broadcast venues over to local high school clubs. While, the school day afternoons can be choppy, the rest of the broadcast day is a smooth, professional experience.</p>
<p>Fun fact: WBER was the first radio station in Rochester NY to offer Internet streaming. I know this since at the time I was working with WXXI, and, with my help, we were second. :(</p>
<p>After a long day of peering over requirements, it’s great to kick back with a great book from <a href="http://librivox.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">LibriVox</a> or a great tune on <a href="http://www.wber.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WBER</a>.</p>

<p>Software projects use repositories to provide for version control and group communications. Whenever a developer makes a change to a local copy of the software source code, he or she “commits” the change to the repository when its is ready to be shared with the group. Developers can also “roll back” a change if a problem is found later.</p>
<p>The ASF provides technical and legal infrastructure for Subversion, Apache HTTPD, and other open source products who have adopted the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html" target="_blank" rel="external">ASF’s meritocratic development model</a>.</p>
<p>Apache HTTPD has been the number one web server on the Internet since April 1996. Apache is also the “A” in the popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29" target="_blank" rel="external">LAMP stack</a> that powers other products, like the Drupal content management system.</p>
<p>The annual ASF convention, ApacheCon, is being held Nov 1-5 in Atlanta GA. Join me there for my talk on <a href="http://na.apachecon.com/c/acna2010/sessions/561" target="_blank" rel="external">The Open Source Secret Sauce</a>.</p>

        <p><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://www.podcastingnews.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/social-media-bandwagon.jpg" alt=""></a></div><br>Long before Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter hit the scene, membership organizations hosted mailing lists, where members could reach out for help and help each other. Today, many nonprofits and associations are recasting their venerable “listservs” as social networking sites.</p>
<p>While public sites like LinkedIn provide free forums, larger organizations with broader constituencies often need more capabilities than a free public site can provide out of the box.</p>
<p>Happily, there are some great options available, both hosted (“in the cloud”) and on-premises (“on your network”).</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Hosted Solutions </span></p>
<p>Four great alternatives for non-profits, especially organizations already using iMIS or Salesforce, are GoLightly, Higher Logic, The Port, and Socious.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>GoLightly </strong>[<a href="http://www.golightly.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">www.golightly.com</a>] is a solid “one stop shop” solution that works standalone or with iMIS and other membership management systems. My professional organization, the <a href="http://www.theiiba.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">IIBA</a>, uses GoLightly. It lacks the “pizzaz” of some other solutions, but GoLightly gets the job done, without getting in the way.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Higher Logic</strong> [<a href="http://www.higherlogic.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">www.higherlogic.com</a>] is a forward-looking offering, that stirs the social networking pot with add-ons like Member Ad, an advertising service for community sites. Many features, like microsites and calendars, can be delivered “stand alone”, so you don’t have to buy the whole gorilla if all you want is a banana.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ThePort </strong>[<a href="http://www.theport.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">www.theport.com</a>] is a comprehensive solution that rivals systems like Facebook in the look-and-feel department. Not just a pretty face, ThePort offers deep extensibility through its App Portal and Data Exchange platforms. If you’re ready to take the deep dive, check out ThePort.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Socious </strong><a href="http://www.socious.com/%5D" target="_blank" rel="external">[www.socious.com]</a> offers a broad and deep set of social management tools that revolve around four spokes: Social Networking, Online Communities, Knowledge Repositories and Event Management. Socious released a mobile community app in August 2010, optmized for iPhone, Blackberry Storm, Palm Pre/Pixi, and Android 1.5+.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the hosted solutions have their own “flavor” (and price point). The best fit can depend more on your organization’s culture than on a simple feature matrix.</p>
<p>While hosted solutions offer great capabilities with low startup costs, many organizations still look to on premises solutons for tighter integration with an existing site.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">On Premises Solutions </span></p>
<p>Both Ektron and Drupal provide flexible social networking capabilities that can be woven into an existing site, or setup as an independent site. Key advantages of an on premise solution include a consistent approach to administration and a full-site search that can include all resources.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ekron CMS400.NET</strong> [<a href="http://www.ektron.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">www.ektron.com</a>] is a general purpose content management system (CMS) with strong social networking capabilities. An Ektron website can be extended to include community groups, where each group has its own set of collaboration tools, including a Calendar, Forum, and Document Library. Using our Ektron/iMIS provider, we can automatically create Ektron groups based on a user’s iMIS profile.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Drupal Organic Groups</strong> [<a href="http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/og" target="_blank" rel="external">drupal.org/handbook/modules/og</a>] is a popular extension to a leading free open source CMS. Drupal OG is an elegant, flexible solution that is often used as part of a larger enterprise site, such as www.imiscommunities.com and . There are also Drupal offerings that provide full workgroup capabilities, like Drupal Commons and Open Atrium.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardest part of today’s social media landscape is that it’s become an “embarrassment of riches”. A good starting point is to study the <a href="http://tedhusted.blogspot.com/2010/09/idealware-nonprofit-social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Social Media Technology Guide</a> by Idealware, and follow its advice to be sure you are getting the most from public offerings. Then, fill any gaps with one the solutions outlined here. Before long, your perfect solution can be “out there”, helping members help themselves.</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Windows Live Office Groups</a> is a free service for the personal use of groups of up to a thousand of your closest peeps. The only catch is that everyone needs a (free) Windows Live ID. Although Groups is free for personal use, every page on the site does includes a sidebar advertisement (annoying, animated advertisements). One other current restriction is that there is a limit on the number of groups one Windows Live account can create or join. You can create up to 20 groups (using one account), and join up to a total of 40.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the browser list is longer than you might expect. (A clear signal that MS is ready to complete with Google in the online office space.)</p>

<li><p><strong>Windows:</strong> Internet Explorer versions 7 and 8, Firefox 3.5 or later versions, and Chrome 3 or later versions.<br>Each group has its own set of areas for Discussions, Documents, Photos, Calendar, Membership, and SkyDrive. The navigation is clean and simple. Anyone who understands breadcrumbs should have no trouble bouncing between area. There is also a modest selection of alternative styles dress up the navigation bar.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Discussions</strong> - A simple but effective online forum, making it easy for members to post messages without CC’ing the world. Administrative features including editing and deleting posts, and deleting entire discussions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Documents</strong> - Any type of file can be uploaded, and you can edit the permission to restrict usage. Office documents can be viewed or edited online, or downloaded and edited locally (if you have the corresponding Office application installed). Editing or uploading a document creates a new version automatically. It’s even easy to flip between versions and restore an older one, if need be.</p>

<li><p><strong>Photos</strong> - Create albums and upload images to share with the group.</p>

<li><p><strong>Calendar</strong> - Track key dates on the group’s calendar and integrate with your own calendar and with calendars for other groups. There is also an option for a daily email alert of upcoming events.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Membership </strong>- Each participant can be in one of three security roles: Owner, Co-Owner, and Member. The Owner can be changed, and only the owner can delete a group.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Group Landing Page</strong> - The main page for the group summarizes activity from the other areas, making it easy to see what’s happening.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The group may also have an “Email group” feature which works like a mailing list. The confusing bit is that some messages will end up in the Discussion area and some will end up in email, diluting the effectiveness of both.  A third endpoint for discussions is group chat. If enabled, up to forty people in your group members can pile on via Windows Messenger.</p>
<p>The group email feature can be turned off, and individual members can opt out of group email. The missing option is email alerts for discussions. Also missing is a RSS feed of the group’s activities.</p>
<p>For extra credit, <a href="http://smallbusiness.officelive.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="external">you can also create a free website</a> for your group (or other purpose) – but that would be yet another series.</p>
<p>Like Google Apps and Google Sites, Windows Live and Office Live Groups offer a broad platform that can be targeted for specific projects. Next week, we will close up the Workgroup Site series with a look at Open Atrium, another example of narrowing a broad platform.</p>
