        <p>People often comment on the number of Java web development frameworks. The Evolutionary Goo blog has an excellent summary of <a href="http://evolutionarygoo.com/blog/?p=94" target="_blank" rel="external">Java web framework taxonomies</a>.</p>
<p>Now, can someone do the same for Ajax libraries? I’ve heard tell that there are about 200 Ajax libraries in use today – which puts the Java framework community to shame, especially when we’ve had a five-year head start. :)</p>

        <p>Dojo has cachet, but the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library has got the goods. YUI is fast, well-designed, and well-documented. Yes, documented. Not just API docs, but tutorial-style documentation with honest-to-goodness examples.</p>
<p>Here’s the catch: the YUI site is organized like an encyclopedia. Everything is in arbitrary, alphabetic order. Great for looking stuff up later. Bad for getting started now.</p>
<p>If you’re ready for Ajax, but your JavaScript skills are not, first spend a quality day with the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=crockford_clips" target="_blank" rel="external">Crockford Clips</a>, courtesy of YUI Theatre. It’s just enough knowledge to make an object-orientated programmer dangerous.</p>
<p>Once you are over the OO JavaScript hurdle, the remaining challenge is ramping up with YUI itself.</p>
<p>To get started with YUI, I recommend reviewing the slide overview from <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/slides/2006/xtech/yui-slides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">XTech Developers Day</a>, and and then following the “<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5208774#trail" target="_blank" rel="external">Happy Trails</a>“ through the documentation. If you take your time and try some of the exercises on your own machine, it could take a day or three to get through it all. (Though, if you’re like me, about half-way through, you’ll be off coding your own application, and leaving the rest for later!)</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="The-Happy-Trails"><a href="#The-Happy-Trails" class="headerlink" title="The Happy Trails"></a>The Happy Trails</h3><p>After browsing the XTech slides, I suggest reviewing the YUI documentation in a step-by-step order. I’ve divided the trail into three legs.</p>
<p>First Leg - YUI builds on several “backbone” packages that hold the library together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahoo Global</li>
<li>Dom</li>
<li><p>Event</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/17/event-plan/" target="_blank" rel="external">Event-Driven Application Design</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Element</p>
</li>
<li>Logger</li>
<li>Connection</li>
<li>Animation</li>
<li><p>Drag and Drop<br>Second Leg - The library provides several workhorse packages that manage and display data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Container</p>
</li>
<li><p>Module, Overlay, Panel, Tooltip, Dialog,<br>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><p>SimpleDialog</p>
</li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Tabview</li>
<li>TreeView</li>
<li>DataSource</li>
<li>DataTable<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Home Stretch - Other library controls provides special effects, like sliders, buttons, and calendars, along with browser history management, and grid-based layouts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Autocomplete</li>
<li>Button</li>
<li>Slider</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Browser History Manager</li>
<li>Reset, Fonts, and Grids (This could also be viewed first.)<br>The mass of YUI documentation can seem imposing at first, but if you break it down, and follow the trail, you’ll be up and running in a New York minute. :)</li>

<p>Of course, if you have some latitude as to what version of Struts to use, do take a look at <a href="http://struts.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Struts 2</a> :)</p>
<p>Except for “WebWork in Action”, I don’t believe there are any S2 books quite yet, but the materials from my S2 training course are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sq1-struts2/" target="_blank" rel="external">available online</a>.</p>

        <p>With its Premier Edition, <a href="https://www.google.com/a/" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Apps</a> may make the virtual workplace a reality for larger corporations. Other concerns, like Yahoo and <a href="http://bluetie.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">BlueTie</a>, have been offering virtual corporation email and more for some time.<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9007884&amp;pageNumber=1" target="_blank" rel="external">several online office suites</a>, like Google Apps, and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/webified_desktop_apps_vs_browser_apps.php" target="_blank" rel="external">WebOS applications</a>, are ready to take it to <a href="http://www.allpeers.com/blog/2007/03/22/the-future-of-applications/" target="_blank" rel="external">the next level</a>.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, some organizations might hesitate at keeping essential records on someone else’s hardware. But, realistically, most hosting services have better backup procedures that most corporate houses. Outfits like BlueTie, Yahoo, and Google are definitely leaders in uptime services and disaster recovery planning.</p>
<p>I daresay that if all the records in New Orleans had been stored on the <a href="http://www.infonortics.com/publications/google/google-legacy.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Googleplex</a>, we would not have lost so much data to Katrina. And, that’s something to think about. We like to fret about terrorist attacks, but year-after-year, we lose much more to natural disasters. The more data we have backed up on redundant virtual systems, the less data we will lose the next time a flood, quake, or hurricane strikes. Lest we forget, the original internet was designed to survive a nuclear disaster.</p>
<p>And inch by inch, the Internet is becoming omnipresent. We can already access the Internet from anywhere we can get cell reception. I’ve watched geeks blog from conferences in real time by hooking a laptop up to a cell phone. Right now, that kind of connectivity is an additional fee that most of us don’t want to pay, but that will change.</p>
<p>Online banking is already old-hat, for both personal and business use. My business account at HSBC is so secure that I can barely use it myself. My username and passwords are longer than usual, and I have to get a magic number from a LCD dongle on every login. At one point, I needed my password reset, and I had to present an affidavit to the local branch. (Really, I did!) Though, I suppose a Klingon-secure bank account is not a bad thing :)</p>
<p>I flew to Milwaukee in January to host a training course, and I was pleased to find free wifi connectivity in every airport along the way, including our own itsy-bitsy Rochester International. If I had brought my HSBC dongle, I could have even done some banking!</p>
<p>Today, running your business over the Internet is almost inescapable. If you make payroll deductions, you may even be compelled to <a href="https://www.eftps.com/eftps/" target="_blank" rel="external">deposit withholdings online</a>.</p>
<p>Cell phones too are almost inescapable. It was one thing when single adults did without landlines, but now the nuclear family next door is doing the same. I have friends with a teenage son that don’t have a home phone: just three cell phones. We’d consider doing the same, but we have a Time Warner “all in one account”, so the home phone doesn’t cost much more. It’s not even a real landline. It’s telephony-over-cable-over-Internet. But, hey, the long distance is free!</p>
<p>(Just who is Jack Bauer’s cell phone carrier? I’d love a magical phone that get can reception even in an abandoned sewer tunnel with a battery than never runs dry. I’m surprised that Verizon hasn’t snapped Kiefer up as a spokesperson!)</p>
<p>The next step in cell phone evolution is likely to be “stationary” lines that can share cell minutes. That way people could still have a phone at home and another on the go, without having two bills to pay. Or, we could just cut to the chase and get on with the subdermal iPhone implants!</p>
<p>When not taking calls on our cell phones, my office orders our <a href="http://www.filetaxes.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">w-2’s online</a>, and we backups key files to a remote <a href="http://wush.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Subversion repository</a>. We’ve been experimenting with sharing Google Applications too. I seem to have a learning disability when it comes to graphics software and spreadsheets. But, the Google spreadsheet is easy enough to use, even for a knucklehead like me.</p>
<p>Of course, being an ASF geek, what I like best about Google Apps is the built-in collaboration features. You can share a document or spreadsheet with any other googler, or with the public generally, either read-only or read-write. That Google Apps bake-in sharing is truly joyful, since collaboration is the answer.</p>
<p>I work remotely with clients over the Internet, most often to pair-program. We’ve tried a number of products, including Windows Messenger and RealVNC. Our new best friend is an add-on to <a href="http://skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Skype</a>, called <a href="http://www.unyte.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Unyte</a>. You can make the telephone-over-internet call with Skype, and then bring up application sharing with Unyte. The free version generously allows up to four people to conference into your desktop.</p>
<p>We seem to be experiencing a bit more latency with Unyte, especially when a remote caller tries to take control. But, Unyte is able to connect through my client’s firewall, which has been a problem with Messenger lately. (RealVNC still works, but only over the VPN, and only if the sharing happened from my client’s side.)</p>
<p>I know many corporations still value “seat time”, but using open source practices, I’m easy to track what’s happening from where I sit. All of my work ends up in Subversion, Confluence, or JIRA (are these ever going to be one product?), all of which post to a mailing list as I work. I make frequent commits are mainly so that I can roll back to a working version if I break something, but also to document my work for my colleagues, step by step. It’s easy for anyone following the list to see how much I’ve done when.</p>
<p>Minute to minute, it’s likely that I’m the best documented worker in the enterprise :)</p>

        <p>As might be expected, the Struts 2 GA announcement had its share of comments on <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=44429" target="_blank" rel="external">The Server Side</a> last week.</p>
<p>One subtopic was push versus pull. As with many terms, I think we sometimes use “push” and “pull” to mean different things. Sometimes we mean it to contrast <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=44429#228491" target="_blank" rel="external">component versus action paradigms</a>. Other times, we mean to contrast <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/turbine/turbine-2.3.2/pullmodel.html" target="_blank" rel="external">creating a custom context</a> (or API) for each page that exposes only what that page is suppose to know (push), or whether we should create a global context (or API) that can be exposed to every page, so each page can pick and choose (pull) whatever it wants.</p>
<p>Another use of the “push/pull” term is to contrast “merge” templates, like Velocity and FreeMarker, with “scriptlet” templates, like ASP, JSP, and PHP. In this usage, the point is whether it is better to push out to the page a prepared context, or whether the page should use scriplets to pull values from the platform’s shared context.</p>
<p>One benefit of push is that it easier to use the technology outside of the environment, since we can create a prepared context independent of the target platform. One benefit of pull is that its easier to share values with other application resources, since the context is shared.</p>
<p>Struts 1 tends to muddle this kind of push and pull. ActionForms are push, but we also provide a lot of servlet attributes which pages need to pull from one of the platform’s scopes (page, servlet, application). The Velocity support for Struts uses a chained context to provide access to a Velocity context as well as the platform contexts.</p>
<p>Struts 2 creates its own context that includes references to the servlet scopes (as plain-old Maps). In this way, S2 provides the benefits of both push and pull. For testing, it’s easy to create our own action context, and at runtime, we can access the usual servlet resources. Another benefit of wrapping pull-within-push is that we can provide “first class” tag support for JSP, FreeMarker and Velocity.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m a fan of the template approach. The Struts 1 tags mitigated the <a href="http://www.servlets.com/soapbox/problems-jsp.html" target="_blank" rel="external">damage JSP scriplets were causing back in the day</a>; before JSTL, stock JSPs were a ugly, inelegant mess. (And before Velocity people got involved in JSTL, the JSTL was a mess too.)</p>
<p>If there is a single reason why Struts 1 was so successful, it was because we provided a JSP taglib when everyone else (Barracuda, JPublish, Maverick, Tapestry, Turbine, among others) was focused on templates and other alternative solutions.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve consulted with some large concerns that standardized on templates pre-y2k. The technology worked well, but my clients eventually replaced the templates with Struts and JSPs. Not because JSP was “better”, but because JSP worker drones are easy to hire. <a href="http://www.servlets.com/soapbox/problems-jsp-reaction.html" target="_blank" rel="external">As Craig said</a>, project managers tend to choose “mainstream” technologies, regardless. We already have a hammer, so every problem must be a nail.</p>
<p>Ironically, Struts 2 “levels the playing field”, so that “alternative” technologies like Velocity, Freemarker, and AJAX are on equal footing with “mainstream” technologies like JSP, JSF, and, well, AJAX. :)</p>
