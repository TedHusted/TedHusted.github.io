        <p><a href="http://google.com/a/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/2c414-google-apps.jpg" alt=""></a>Over the Thanksgiving weekend, I moved my personal website (<a href="http://www.husted.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">husted.com</a>) to <a href="http://google.com/a/" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Apps</a>. The GA move will save me website hosting fees (the Standard Edition is free), while providing me new services my plain old HTML site didn’t have. Since we also use GA at <a href="http://www.vandamme.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">VanDamme</a>, I’ll also have a familiar, seamless environment, whether at work or at home. The trade-off is that my website’s look and feel is harder to customize, but, after ten years without an overhaul, I’m ready for a change.</p>
<p>Google Apps refers to a set of Google “point” applications, which, when used together, can create a virtual workplace. In practice, Google Apps is the equivalent of Microsoft Office and Outlook. Google Apps is free and delivered over the web. There is nothing to install, and you can access your assets from a web browser anywhere on the Internet.</p>
<p>The applications in the Google Apps suite are</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Talk</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Docs (word processing, spreadsheets, presentations)</li>
<li>Start Page</li>
<li>Sites<br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mail </span>(aka GMail) is a popular email client, that many people may already use. Mail is the core of Google Apps and shares resources with Talk and Calendar.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Chat </span>(aka GTalk, aka Talk) is featureful instant messaging application, and includes handy voice mail and file transfer utilities. Talk is exposed through Mail, and stores chat transcripts as Mail messages.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Calendar </span>shares its contact list with Mail, making it easy to schedule appointments with other people in your organization. It’s also easy to overlay any other Google Calendars that might be part of your busy modern life. Mail will also scan messages, looking for items that you might want to add to Calendar. I can display my personal Husted dot Com calendar alongside my VanDamme calendar, without commingling appointments.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Docs </span>provides online editing of word processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. While not as powerful as offline equivalents, Google Docs offers powerful collaborative features that you won’t find elsewhere.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Start Page </span>(aka iGoogle) is an personalized portal lending instant access to other applications in the Google Apps suite.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sites </span>is a web page builder that can be used to create special-purpose project portals. You can create a basic web page with a WYSIWYG editor, or add special page types, like a filing cabinet or message center.</p>
<p>But, wait, there’s more: Apps can also integrate with applications hosted by the Google Apps Engine, among others.</p>
<p>Finally, the services are a la carte, and you can disable any you don’t want to use with your domain (including mail).</p>
<p>Moving a site over is relatively painless. To use Google Apps, you do need a domain – either one you already own or a new one (that Google will help you purchase at a discount). To move an existing domain to GA, you need access to the CNAME and MX records. (The Help center has articles with specific instructions for most domain registrars.) The CNAME record will route request for addresses like “www.your-domain.com” to the Google servers. The MX record will route your domain email</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to use a web site as a collaborative tool, either for home or a small office, give Google Apps a gander. As a suite, it’s far from perfect, but Google Apps is still solid and useful platform.</p>

        <p><a href="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/96609-unlimitedcoaching.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/96609-unlimitedcoaching.jpg?w=171" alt=""></a>As is our habit, VanDamme Associates introduced its latest bundle of newbies to a team building workshop provided by <a href="http://www.unlimitedcoaching.com/" title="Unlmited Coaching Solutions" target="_blank" rel="external">Unlmited Coaching Solutions</a>. In preparation for the training, we were asked to answer a long (and annoying) series of questions in an online survey, which all took the format.</p>
<p>Select the one phase that best describes you at work.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like challenges.</li>
<li>I like interacting with people.</li>
<li>I tend to be relaxed and easy going.</li>
<li><p>I tend to have high standards.<br>When training day came around, the delightful woman leading the session presented us with the result of our surveys. The training had headlined a self-actualization model called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Agreements" title="The Four Agreements" target="_blank" rel="external">The Four Agreements</a>“, but, as it turns out, the training also covered our Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness, or DiSC, behaviorial dimensions. The notion is that each of us have the four DiSC qualities in varying degrees. Team communication goes awry when someone with a high Dominance dimension interacts with someone with a high Conscientiousness dimension. One person is focussed on function, and another is focussed on form. Reasoning that would convince one person, fails to convince the other, and people end up taking past one another.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>D</strong>ominance - relating to control, power and assertiveness</p>
</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nfluence - relating to social situations and communication</li>
<li><strong>S</strong>teadiness - relating to patience, persistence, and thoughtfulness</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>onscientiousness - relating to structure and organization<br>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment" title="DiSC behavioral model" target="_blank" rel="external">DiSC behavioral model</a> was pioneered by William Moulton Marston in 1928 (who also created the polygraph and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_woman" title="Wonder Woman" target="_blank" rel="external">Wonder Woman</a> comic book), and refined by other researchers over the years. The Unlimited Coaching package includes a bar chart showing each of our four DiSC qualities in relation to one another, and pages of predictive advice based on the how those qualities interact. I can’t speak for anyone else, but the result of my own DiSC assessment is just plain spooky. I’d love to have a set of these for the wife and kids :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, to keep things even more interesting, the training included a run down of the Four Agreements, as promised. Coined by a Mexican surgeon, Miguel Ruiz, who returned to his family’s Toltec roots after a near-death experience, the Four Agreements are designed to help us live happier, more productive lives.</p>
<p>1. Be impeccable with your word.<br>2. Don’t take it personally.<br>3. Don’t make assumptions.<br>4. Always do your best.</p>
<p>As principles go, the 4As are quite nice, and even strangely complementary to the DISC assessment.</p>
<p>As a longtime dabbler in self-improvement texts, I’m a huge fan of Stephen Covey’s the <a href="http://www.jroller.com/TedHusted/entry/habits" title="Seven Habits of Highly Successful People" target="_blank" rel="external">Seven Habits of Highly Successful People</a>. Covey mentions that many behavioral models have four key focal points, such as the biblical qualities of Heart, Mind, Soul and Strength. Since we have four DiSC dimension and four habits, let’s try mapping the two together.</p>

<p><td>Don’t make assumptions.</td><br><br><br><br>Hmmm. Covey recently added an 8th habit (“Teach the habits.”). Each of the habits is considered to be either a public habit or a private habit. If we combine the public and private habits into one, we are left with, waddyaknow, Four Habits. Let’s map all four systems together.</p>

<p>PS: For extra credit, try adding your own mappings for the four physical dimensions: Width, Height, Length, and Time :)</p>

        <p>Back in the 20th century, I tried every PIM (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Personal Information Manager</a>) that I could beg, buy, or borrow: Sidekick, Outlook, Time and Chaos, Goldmine, the list goes on. On my technology memorabilia shelf, I still have a copy of Ecco (right next to a copy of Clarion). Eventually, I gave up the the search for a PIM El Dorado, and devolved to use a series of plain-old Notepad text files, organized by week. The Notepad advantage being I could just jot things down without worrying about pigeon holes.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/0cea6-google-notebook.jpg" alt=""></a>Lately, instead of my trusty Notepads, I find myself turning toward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Notebook</a> . I remember trying it some time ago, and it failed to satisfy. I don’t remember why, but trying it again this year, it’s been working well for me. Maybe because I’m using it as a PIM, rather than a surfing tool.</p>
<p>The Notebook paradigm is a hearty step up from a plain-old text file. We can create any number of “Notebooks”, each of which contains one or more Notes. Each note is essentially a simple text file, but with some simple formatting options, like bullets, links, and fonts (oh my!). A Notebook can have zero or more Sections that contain zero or more Notes. A Google Notebook account can contain any number of Notebooks, and we drag Notes or Sections between Notebooks.</p>
<p>Like most Google critters, Notebook lives on the cloud. (Meaning the good news is that I don’t have to back it up myself, and the bad news is that I don’t have my own backups.) Being on the cloud, Notebook offers sharing options, much like Google Sites or Google Documents. I haven’t tried to share a notebook with anyone yet (but knowing VanDamme Associates, and our penchant for sharing, eventually I will!).</p>
<p>Two other organizational features (that I literally just noticed) are comments are labels. The comment feature provides a secondary tab where a collaborator can add a remark without editing the main Note text. Essentially, the label feature is a persistent search. We can list arbitrary labels to apply to any given note. As soon as we do, the labels panel is updated with the name of the label and the number of notes that use it. Selecting a label from the panel open a search result, listing the approptiate notes.</p>
<p>Whenever some bit of data comes along, and I need a place to tuck it away, I can pull up my Google Notebook and bang it in. Later, if I want to transfer the data to another artifact, up comes the Notebook, and out goes the Note.</p>
<p>Plain-old weekly text files do provide one great feature: Auto-archiving. Each week, I opened up a new text file and started with a clean slate. With the Notebook, I may need to do some occasional housekeeping to keep my data stream tidy. Film at 11 …</p>

        <p>If you have a hankering for quick access to US government services, surf on by <a href="http://www.usa.gov/" title="usa.gov" target="_blank" rel="external">usa.gov</a>. Originally, FirstGov.gov, the nation’s portal has evolved from a special project to a regular appropriation of the US Congress. Positioned as the US government’s answer to Google, the mission of <a href="http://www.usa.gov/" title="usa.gov" target="_blank" rel="external">usa.gov</a> is to help find existing resources. Other US government sites create content, and <a href="http://www.usa.gov/" title="usa.gov" target="_blank" rel="external">usa.gov</a> exposes it.</p>
<p><a href="http://usa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/dbb3d-usa-gov.jpg" alt=""></a>Ironically, a great way that <a href="http://usa.gov/" title="usa.gov" target="_blank" rel="external">usa.gov</a> exposes content is by creating it. The site features a daily blog called “<a href="http://blog.usa.gov/roller/govgab/" title="Gov Gab" target="_blank" rel="external">Gov Gab</a> “ that is the handiwork of a handful of federal employees who work the Office of Citizen Services and Communications at the U.S. General Services Administration. The blogs mix a health dose of links with personal and professional anecdotes.</p>
<p>For those of us who surf to edit, other sites of note include the <a href="http://ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/tech.shtm" title="FTC" target="_blank" rel="external">FTC’s Computers and The Internet section</a> and the <a href="http://usabilty.gov/" title="Usabilty.gov" target="_blank" rel="external">Usabilty.gov</a> site. The former hosts vital advice on Internet security and privacy, and the later catalogs essential tips on creating easy to use sites.</p>

        <p>On October 7, about two dozen RIT Computer Science students came for Salvatore’s famous Buffalo Wing Pizza, but stayed for the scintillating tales of Ajax testing derring do.</p>
<div><a href="http://csc.masterpi.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/b5d49-rit-csc.jpg" alt=""></a>Of those present only a few had Ajax experience. (Not surprising, since Ajax is not part of the formal curriculium!) Happily, Ajax 101 was included in the talk (just for that eventuality). The presentation is available through <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ted.husted" target="_blank" rel="external">SlideShare</a>. The presentation covers several of my favorite testing tools, including:</div>

<ul>
<li>Selenium - <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://selenium.openqa.org/</a></li>
<li>Hudson - <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://hudson.dev.java.net/</a></li>
<li>Tomcat - <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://tomcat.apache.org/</a></li>
<li><p>YUI Test - <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/</a></p>
<div>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2R-03clK4" target="_blank" rel="external">lively crowd</a> raised a number of good questions, including:</div>
</li>
<li><p>Is YUI Unit better than JsUnit?</p>
</li>
<li>Does social networking require Ajax?</li>
<li>Are shoes required at VanDamme Associates?<div>Answers: <em>Yes, No, Sometimes</em></div></li>
</ul>
