    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <div>While Google deserves credit for bringing out an early preview of their new Wave technology, there are several lessons to be learned from the experience.</div><br><div></div><br><div><span style="font-size:130%;">1 No help link</span></div><br><div></div><br><div>If there is one thing wrong with the Wave Preview, it’s that there’s no Help link in the menu bar. Even a popup window telling us how to search for the (self-hosted) “Welcome Waves” documentation would make a huge difference.</div><br><div></div><br><div><span style="font-size:130%;">2 Ambiguous bug reporting </span></div><br><div></div><br><div>The user interface has a “Create Bug” link (sic), but it’s broken. Outside of that, there is a Known Issues wave, and a Release Notes wave, and also a Google Code issue tracker. Not all of the issues listed elseswhere are reflected in the public issue tracker. While Team Wave must have their own comprehensive issue tracker, there is no one outward-facing place where we can see if a bug has been reported or not.</div><br><div></div><br><div><span style="font-size:130%;">3 No roadmap to indicate planned features</span></div><br><div></div><br><div>While there unimplemented controls in the user interface, and scattered references to planned features, there does not seem to be an outward-facing roadmap that indicates which features are planned to be implemented and when. Not knowing what is already planned leads to a lot of general agnst, fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Also, since there is no list of Google Team Members, we can’t discern between a pundit’s guess and a team member’s assurance.</div><br><div></div><br><div><span style="font-size:130%;">4 No undo or revert</span></div><br><div></div><br><div>When you are testing alpha-quality editing software, it hurts not to have an undo. Worse, if something is deleted, by yourself or someone else, there’s is no revert. One recourse is to use the the Playback feature and copy and paste a prior version to the head. If a Wave has had many changes (some are in the 100s), it can take five or ten minutes for the Preview to “fast forward” to the latest version.</div><br><div></div><br><div><span style="font-size:130%;">5 No editing restrictions</span></div><br><div></div><br><div>While Team Google can “hack” sometimes a wave to prevent editing, no type of access control feature has been implemented. Everyone can edit anything, which, without undo or revert, is leading to lost content.</div><br><div></div><br><div><span style="font-size:130%;">6 No external documentation </span></div><br><div></div><br><div>The only documentation for the client application is spread out over half-a-dozen waves. It’s great that Team Wave is eager to be self-hosting, but, honestly, it’s way too early to present the documentation as a waves. As it is, we’re being giving a DVD player which ships with 100% of the setup instructions on a DVD. The Sandbox is hosted as a Google App, so it would be easy to provide documentation as a Google Doc. While that may not be eating your own dog foot, we’d at least be eating cat food by the same vendor.</div><br><div></div><br><div><span style="font-size:130%;">7 No internal announcement mechanism </span></div><br><div></div><br><div><br><br>When improvements are made to the environment, the word trickles out. An announcement might be posted, or the release notes might be updated, but there is no central page where all changes are guaranteed to be posted. The sandbox inbox is chaotic, and it’s hard to discern between important updates from Team Wave and the general sandbox chatter. Again, a help page that indicated important changes would make a world of difference.<br><br>These points have been added to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-wave-resources/issues/list" target="_blank" rel="external">Google API issue tracker</a>. If you have a Preview account, and agree, drop by and star a few.<br><br></div>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>(Google has made a limited number of development accounts available for a preview of its forthcoming “Wave” product. <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/wavesignup/" target="_blank" rel="external">If you get yours</a>, look me up. I’m ted.husted@wavesandbox.com.)</p>
<p>A few years back, when I first tried <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">IntelliJ IDEA</a>‘s refactoring tools, I felt like I was pair programming with Commander Data. In the background, IDEA would compile my code, correct my syntax, and suggest fixes when my programming got sloppy. IDEA helped me write better code in less time.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog-wave.appspot.com/jaaron" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/29e4c-waveiquette.png" alt=""></a>Being a Camelot of good ideas, <a href="http://tedhusted.blogspot.com/2009/07/fifth-wave-googles-real-time.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Wave</a>, in the guise of robots, includes its own twist on intelligent background agents. Spelly scans input to a wave and corrects spelling errors on the fly (<a href="http://sheenonline.biz/2009/06/12-reasons-why-google-wave-will-change-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="external">using the web as its dictionary</a>). Likewise, Linky scans the wave for text that looks like a hyperlink. If the reference leads to YouTube, Linky will even offer to embed a player into the wave. If language is a barrier to collaboration, Rosy the robot (no joke) will translate a wave into your native language.</p>
<p>To a wave, a robot is just another participant on the wave. A wave is often described as a conversation between participants. (In fact, to use a robot with a wave, you add the robot as a participant.) Just like any other participant, a robot can make real-time changes to the content.</p>
<p>Also like a human participant, a robot can interact with an external system. For example, <a href="http://wavety.com/tweety-google-wave-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tweety </a> can post from a wave to a Twitter account, and <a href="http://wavety.com/bloggy-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bloggy</a> can post a wave to a blog. If any changes are made to the wave, Bloggy will update the blog entry.</p>
<p>Aside from blogs, there are many other systems that a wavebot could update. While Wave has its own version control, a robot could also update an external Subversion repository with all changes made to a wave. Likewise, a robot could create a static HTML page from a wave, so we could edit a wave and automatically update a high-performance website.</p>
<p>Even though Wave is only in developer preview, there are already dozens of robots available, and more are being written every day. (A new website, <a href="http://wavety.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Wavety.com</a>, is already creating a directory of Robots and Gadgets.)</p>
<p>An “interesting” new robot is <a href="http://wavety.com/eliza-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">Eliza the Robot therapist</a>. Eliza scans the wave input looking for chances to reflect. “How do you feel about that?” (Some people are calling Eliza the first spambot!) If you are unsure whether to chat with Eliza, decide with a quick round of <a href="http://wavety.com/roshambo-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">rock/paper/scissors</a><a href="http://wavety.com/roshambo-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">.</a></p>
<p>Already, I am feeling a need for a reverse Turing Test for wave participants – is it live or is it cybernext?</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Press the Button</span></p>
<p>If robots are the workhorses of Wave, gadgets are the showdogs. Gadgets add interactive forms and animations to a wave, imposing focus and structure over participant input. Several gadgets are already available, including Polly, for polls, and Checky, for checklists. The gadget API is compatible with OpenSocial, making a host of existing gizmos available to wave developers.</p>
<p>Of course, the real test of any gadget platform is games. Already, we are seeing several multiplayer games bobbing into waves, including <a href="http://wavety.com/play-chess-gadget/" target="_blank" rel="external">chess </a>and <a href="http://wavety.com/sudoku-gadget/" target="_blank" rel="external">soduko</a>.</p>
<p>Although the full power of Wave is still rising to the surface, it’s easy to see that it will be a powerful platform for project management, content management, intranets, team communication, customer support, and just plain fun.</p>
<p>While we may not be able to use wave as a <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml" target="_blank" rel="external">desert topping or floor wax</a>, with the right robots and gadgets in play, we may be able to use it for everything else.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>At VanDamme Associates (soon to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/VanDammeAssociates#play/all/uploads-all/2/kBuhQsVhEU8" target="_blank" rel="external">fka VA</a>), we like our social media. Besides being blogging and Twitter fanatics, we integrate websites and Association Management Systems with various social media platforms, including ThePort, Go Lightly, and our own Ektron Group Application.</p>
<p>An up and coming player on the social media horizon is Google Wave. Although it is not available to the public now, Google announced a developers version at Google IO on May 28. Google Wave is presented as an open-source, real-time communication platform, combining elements of email, instant messaging, wikis, web chat, social networking, and project management. Google Wave looks to be an elegant, in-browser communication client that anyone can use to bring together a group of friends or business partners. The group following the wave can discuss topics and share files – in real time, character by character.</p>
<p>Along with the real-time dimensions, Wave is bringing extensibility, embeddability, and sharability to the table. We will be able to embed a Wave in any blog or website, and we can also build widgets or gadgets that utilize Waves. Like today’s wikis and Google Docs, anything written within a Wave can be edited by anyone else.</p>
<p><a href="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/images/ss1.gif" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/images/ss1.gif" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Visually, a Wave resembles a rich, web forum. Appearances aside, there are key differences.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Everything is shared.</span> While some web forms allow for editing of posts, being able to edit everything, wiki-style, is part of the Wave DNA.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Not everyone is human.</span> The environment includes helper robots that access the Wave as if they were collabators. Some of the robots already in service include Debuggy (an in-wave debugger), Stocky (which pulls stock prices based on stock quote mentions), Tweety (the Twave robot, which displays tweets inside of a wave), and Spelly (a natural language spell checker).<span style="font-weight:bold;">Files are first class citizens.</span> While forms and email system often support attachments, we will be able to drag and drop documents and images into a Wave. Within a web, images are presented in albums, sound files can be played, and documents are shared.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Plugins are seamless.</span> Gadget and widgets can be designed to work within a Wave – including rich applications like issue trackers – and other platforms can embed a Wave into a page, much the same way we embed YouTube today, to create, for example, a instant chat room or talk-back channel.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Playback’s a breeze. </span>Wave’s playback feature walks-through how the entire conversation developed from the start, player-piano style, making it to figure out “how we got there from here”. For someone joining a Wave-in-progress, Playback is a great catch-up on the thought process.<br>But, the strangest bit about Wave is that Google is not only enabling collaboration but <span style="font-style:italic;">competition. </span>The “lion’s share” of the product will be available as open source, and there are already basic, non-Google hosted implementations of Wave. Once Wave becomes generally available, companies will be able to install third-party Wave implementations on their own servers and retain control of their own collaborative assets. If a discussion takes place inside a intranet firewall, it can stay within the firewall. (Or, alternatively, just let it ride on the Google cloud.)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, there’s no published schedule indicating when Google Wave will be made available to the public. But, it is real and already available to bleeding edge developers. For more, check the resources section.</p>

        <p>In the third in a series of “talks for smart people”, <a href="http://bluetie.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">BlueTie</a> tonight hosted “To Tweet or Not to Tweet” to an engaged and inquisitive group in Pittsford NY. In fact, if the audience had its way, the talk would have been a hour-long question and answer session.</p>
<p>Some hot-button queries were</p>
<ul>
<li>Why would someone follow over a thousand people?</li>
<li>How do you find people to follow, or people to follow you?</li>
<li>When should I follow, and when should I friend?</li>
<li>Are the social networks converging?</li>
<li>Is privacy an issue? Or a non-issue?</li>
<li>Can Twitter be used a guerrilla marketing tool?</li>
<li>How else can I use Twitter in my business?<br><div style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://ping.fm/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/b5486-ping_fm.png" alt=""></a>In between a battery of of questions, local Twitter guru <a href="http://twitter.com/EmilyCarpenter" target="_blank" rel="external">Emily Carpenter</a> walked us through the basics of <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/husted" target="_blank" rel="external">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=705537703" target="_blank" rel="external">FaceBook</a>, and, especially, <a href="http://twitter.com/tedhusted" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter</a>.</div><br>The Twitter portion of the talk focused on the dizzying number of third-party add-ins. One that caught my eye is <a href="http://ping.fm/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ping.fm</a>. A point of convergence between the social networks is a status message or micro-blog. Ping makes it easy to update your status on one or more networks from a single dashboard. Of course, like most social network applications today, there are missing features, like post-dating messages, but it is still a sweet dashboard. I’ll be trying this one again.</li>
</ul>
<p>As to the Twitter questions, I won’t try to speak for Emily, but here are my own answers.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Why would someone follow over a thousand people? </span></p>
<p>Mainly to get more followers of your own. People often reciprocate: if you follow someone on Twitter, they follow you back. To compensate, Peopleuse third-party Twitter applications to filter out the important feeds or likely tweets.</p>
<p>Personally, I only follow people that I actually want to read regularly. But, I have noticed that following someone usually leads to more follows, even if it’s someone like <a href="http://twitter.com/tonyrobbins" target="_blank" rel="external">@TonyRobbins</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/johntesh" target="_blank" rel="external">@JohnTesh</a>. If you want to be followed, follow someone else.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">How do you find people to follow, or people to follow you?</span></p>
<p>Start by using Twitter’s<a href="http://twitter.com/invitations/find_on_twitter" target="_blank" rel="external"> Find People</a> feature to lookup your friends and colleagues. Look at who they are following for other interesting feeds. Then goto to a site like <a href="http://www.celebritytweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">CelebrityTweet</a> and look for other people that interest you. Also try looking up your favorite authors. (I found <a href="http://twitter.com/StephenRCovey" target="_blank" rel="external">@StevenRCovey</a> that way.)</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">When should I follow, and when should I friend?</span></p>
<p>On Twitter, we follow. On FaceBook, we friend. On LinkedIn, we connect. On Twitter, you can follow anyone who is tweeting things you want to read. On FaceBook, it’s better to friend only people you actually know and trust, especially personal friends that you might join for dinner or drinks. On Linked In, it’s best to connect with professional colleagues that are connected to your career in some way. People that you might interview for or against.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Twitter is that it crosses the line between personal and professional. People expect Twitter to be a mix. Twitter’s a place where you can be a whole person, and not just the work-you or the home-you.</p>
<p>Still, the Internet is forever, so don’t tweet anything you don’t want the grand kids to read, even if they aren’t born yet</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Are the social networks converging?</span></p>
<p>Yes, the network are adopting similar feature sets, and integrators, like Ping.FM, make it easier to reuse content between networks. Someday, there may one be one. But, for now, people tend to use LinkedIn to manage their resume, and FaceBook to manage their social calendar.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Is privacy an issue? Or a non-issue?</span></p>
<p>To older folks (like me), the amount of information teenagers are sharing on social networks is frightening. But, privacy is relative. The key thing to remember is that nothing you share on a social network is private, so don’t say anything you don’t want your mother, kids, or spouse to know. Personally, I hesitate to mention when I will be traveling, or where my kids might be at a certain time. Burglars and stalkers are no strangers to technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Can Twitter be used a guerrilla marketing tool?</span></p>
<p>Absolutely! Just today, SlideShare sent me this email: “We’ve noticed that your slideshow on SlideShare has been getting a LOT of views in the last 24 hours. Great job … you must be doing something right. ;-) Why don’t you tweet or blog this? Use the hashtag #bestofslideshare so we can track the conversation.”</p>
<p>There’s no reason why my SlideShare views should have spiked on Apr 1st. Even though I think it’s a marketing prank, still, I wrote about it. (And, fool me twice, I’m doing it again!)</p>
<p>Another instance is that we have a meeting coming up for the still-forming local chapter of the <a href="http://rochesterny.theiiba.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">International Institute of Business Analysts</a> . To get the word our for our next meeting, one thing we are considering is asking the members to blog and tweet about it.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">How else can I use Twitter in my business?</span></p>
<p>Many people and businesses have Google Alerts in place to search for items of interest. There are Twitter applications that let you do the same thing with Twitter feeds. For example, I mentioned “bikinis” the other day, and suddenly Bikini Beat is a follower. (Don’t ask!)</p>
<p>By proactively searching Twitter for keywords, companies can target consumers or head-off consumer complaints. But, seller beware, in this age of transparency, be upfront and honest. On the Internet, we can Google, but we can’t hide.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Oh, and should you Tweet?</span></p>
<p>If you have to ask, then you should :)</p>
<p>But, only when you have something to say!</p>

The free service makes it easy for people to post a micro-blog in 140 characters or less that can be read by anyone who cares to follow along. The Twitter cachet went over the top on 24 Feb 2009 when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/24/AR2009022403424.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Congress posted back-channel tweets during President Obama’s speech</a>. Twitter has been careening toward the populist gutter ever since, until today, the coolness of tweeting rivals sweater vests and baseball caps.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Twitter is the most ironic, moronic waste of time since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit" title="Trivial Pursuit" target="_blank" rel="external">Trivial Pursuit</a>. Twitter not only pursues trivia, it runs it over, backs up, and runs over it again. Even at 140 characters or less, Twitter is the biggest bandwidth boondoggle since <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2008/09/23/rolling-stone-throbs-hate-palin-american-people" title="Sarah Palin" target="_blank" rel="external">Sarah Palin’s stump speeches</a>. Twitter exposes a new depth of gibber-jabber that should bore to tears even the people gibbering the jabber.</div><br><div></div><br><div>My favorite irony is O’Reilly’s plans for a <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596802813/" title="Twitter book" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter book</a>. Besides the incongruity of a 280+ page book about 140- character micro blogging system, Publisher <a href="http://twitter.com/timoreilly" title="Tim O" target="_blank" rel="external">Tim O’Reilly</a> is one of the world’s worst Twitterer. O’Reilly approaches Twitter like James Joyce approached Ulysses – Stream of conciseness. (Sic.) No filter. No ID. On my screen, out the door. Hour by harrowing hour. All trees, no forest. Hint@Tim: More is not more.</div><br><div>My favorite feed used to be <a href="http://twitter.com/cwalken" title="Chris Walken" target="_blank" rel="external">Chris Walken</a>. Sadly, the person writing it was <a href="http://jezebel.com/5186944/say-it-aint-so-fiddy-celebs-let-non+celebs-ghost+write-their-twitters" target="_blank" rel="external">not actually the actor</a> Christopher Walken, and Twitter censored the feed … weeding orchids and fertilizing dandelions.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Of course, Twitter doesn’t have to be mindless. It could be a cool technology again … if more people would stop tweeting like they were talking to the family parakeet. (“That’s a pretty girl. Polly wanna cracker?”)</div><br><div></div><br><div>Truth be told, I’ve enjoyed tweets from friends doing even mildly interesting things. (I’m looking at you, @Schwebbie!) But, bandwidth is bandwidth, and people with nothing to say, shouldn’t say it over Twitter. Reporting from the back of the Emperor’s closet, here’s some easy tweeting guidelines:</div><br><div></div><br><div>What to tweet:</div>

<ul>
<li>Accepted a proposal.</li>
<li>Finished a book.</li>
<li><p>Bought a car.</p>
<div>What not to tweet:</div>
</li>
<li><p>Good meeting!</p>
</li>
<li>Yummy lunch!</li>
<li><p>Huge dump!</p>
<div>Or, for the ADD enabled, the micro-version:</div>
</li>
<li><p>What to tweet: Milestones.</p>
</li>
<li>What not to tweet: Minutia.<div>

</div></li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, it’s not just the people using Twitter. As a web application, Twitter sucks eggs. It does one thing, and does it poorly. Given a robust and featureful platform, we might attract a better class of twit.</p>
<p>Happily, third parties are busily writing <a href="http://twitter.com/downloads" title="improved Twitter clients" target="_blank" rel="external">improved Twitter clients</a> and <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/twitterapps" title="applications" target="_blank" rel="external">applications</a>, but that doesn’t excuse Twitter’s own lack of innovation. (Or <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10084487-2.html?tag=mncol;txt" title="inability to pick a business model" target="_blank" rel="external">inability to pick a business model</a> to fund innovation.)</p>
<p>Here’s the ten most obvious features that a competent micro-blogging network should offer out-of-the-box (most of which have already been invented):</p>
<p>9. Twits often use tweets as polls, but we have to tabulate the votes by hand (<a href="http://strawpollnow.com/" title="StrawPollNow" target="_blank" rel="external">StrawPollNow</a>).</p>
<p>8. Twitter is a micro-blog, and people also have regular blogs, but we have to post our own tweet when we post a blog (<a href="http://www.pingtwitter.com/" title="PingTwitter" target="_blank" rel="external">PingTwitter</a>).</p>
<p>7. People post URLs in tweets, but what are the most popular URLs being posted? (<a href="http://www.twitturls.com/" title="TwittURLs" target="_blank" rel="external">TwittURLs</a>)</p>
<p>6. Twits have followers, which follow other twits, but Twitter doesn’t recommend which twits we should be following (<a href="http://www.crazybob.org/twubble/" title="Twubble" target="_blank" rel="external">Twubble</a>).</p>
<p>5. Twits like to follow their own followers, but Twitter doesn’t have an autofollow feature (<a href="http://tweetbots.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">TweetBots</a>).</p>
<p>4. People like to re-tweet, but there’s no re-tweet feature, and no handy list of tweets most re-tweeted. (Can you dig it?) (<a href="http://www.retweetrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ReTweetRank</span></a>)</p>
<p>3. We can mark tweets as favorites, but where’s the list of the most favored tweets on the network?</p>
<p>2. The tweet feed is an generic chronology. Where are the categories? The personas? The tags? The Web 2.0? (<a href="http://twemes.com/" title="Twemes" target="_blank" rel="external">Twemes</a>)</p>
<p>1. The platform is so <em><span style="font-weight:bold;">not</span></em> scalable that people have time to get a “<a href="http://mashable.com/2009/02/26/twitter-fail-whale-tattoo/" title="Twitter is Busy" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter is Busy</a>“ tattoo waiting for it come back online.</p>
<p>My prediction for 2010? Twitter becomes MySpace so-yesterday, and a new site with a reasonable feature set becomes the next socially transmitted dementia.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.gliffy.com/examples/wireframes/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/85f60-gliffy-com.png" alt=""></a>Lame but true: Gliffy is my new best friend.</p>
<div><br><br>As a <a href="http://theiiba.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">business analyst</a>, I spend my work days crafting requirements for web applications, which include wireframes that illustrate the page layouts. Web site wireframes are blue prints that define a page’s content and functionality, without conveying design elements, like colors, graphics, or fonts.<br><br></div><br><div><br><br>Since wireframes are one of my key deliverables, I’ve tried a number of different tools, including <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Visio</a>, <a href="http://www.smartdraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">SmartDraw</a>, <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Balsmiq</a>, and <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2009/03/drawing-on-your-creativity-in-docs.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Docs Drawings</a>. For web site wireframes, my hands-down, indispensable, favorite tool-of-choice is <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gliffy</a>.<br><br>Here’s why:<br><br></div>

<ol>
<li>Gliffy is a visual tool fluent in pixels. I can drag and drop shapes in Gliffy to my heart’s content, but I can also specify the precise pixel dimensions, and position shapes at exact positions on the page. Most other tools force you to drag everything into place by hand – which is like flying an airplane without an altimeter!</li>
<li>Gliffy exports drawings to standard formats, like JPEG, PNG, and SVG (Visio). It’s easy to paste Gliffy images into Word docs or insert them into Google Docs.</li>
<li>Gliffy is cloud-based. I can use Gliffy anywhere there’s an Internet connection and a browser. It also works great with Chrome!</li>
<li>Gliffy is reliable and well-supported. After several weeks of hard use, I’ve had exactly one functional issue with Gliffy. I filed a ticket, and an hour later my problem was solved.</li>
<li>Gliffy stores drawings in easy to manage folders, and files that are quick to load, and easy to share.</li>
<li>Gliffy is inexpensive … starting with free. A free account has the same utility as a paid account, but imprints your drawings with a “Powered by Gliffy” advertisement. The paid accounts start a $5 a month for one user, or $25 a month for ten users.<div>(Did I mention that Gliffy lets you specify shapes in pixels?)</div><br><div></div><br><div>The next time you need to whip up a wireframe or UI mockup, do yourself a favor and take <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gliffy</a> for a spin.</div><br><div></div><br><div>(Did I mention it was free?)</div><br><div></div><br><div>See Also: <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/features/20-steps-to-better-wireframing/" target="_blank" rel="external">20 Steps to Better Wireframing</a>.</div></li>

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><span style="font-size:180%;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/f4a79-checkvist.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/f4a79-checkvist.png?w=300" alt=""></a>There’s no shortage of online TODO list managers: <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Remember the Milk</a>, <a href="http://todoist.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Todoist</a>, <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Toodled</a>, just to name a few. A new offering, <a href="http://checkvist.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">CheckVist</a>, brings a second dimension to TODOology: keyboard-friendly outlining.</p>
<p>CheckVist bills itself as an “online collaborative outliner and task list manager”. The bullet points include</p>
<ul>
<li>Jot it down fast with keyboard shortcuts to speed data-entry</li>
<li>Exchange data with other applications through import and export</li>
<li>Refine tasks with unlimited outline levels and multiple checklists</li>
<li>Work with others by sharing checklists and enabling change notification<br>CheckVist is not as feature-rich as similar products, but for brainstorming and outlining, there’s something to be said for a clutter-free interface. While CheckVist supports the notion of “todo”s, it’s really about organizing chunks of information in to a hierarchical list, often with a group of collaborators, not about personal time and deadline management. As a result, CheckVist a great complement to other, more complicated products.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">How fast is data entry?</span></p>
<p>My favorite CheckVist feature is that it’s intuitive (err, “familiar”) to use. Common outlining keyboard shortcuts, like tab and shift-tab work as expected. Items can be moved up and down with the Ctrl+Arrow keys. The UI is geared to multiple lists, making it easy to get in and out of different lists that you may maintain for different project.</p>
<p>The CheckVist UI doesn’t make you think, making it a great product for brainstorming.<br><span style="font-size:130%;"><br>Does CheckVist work with other applications?</span></p>
<p>My second favorite feature is the easy and elegant way CheckVist imports and exports data. Several convenient formats are supported, including plain test (tabs), Atlassian Confluence format (wiki), OPML format (Mac), and HTML format. When exporting, you can include or exclude notes, status, and change details.</p>
<p>For super-fast data-entry, my favorite approach is to whip up a tab-based outline in a programmer’s editor, and then import it to CheckVist for refinement. If you need to include an outline in a Word document, it’s very easy to export it as plain text, paste it into Word, and convert your outline to a bulleted list with just a click or three.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to copy checklists, either by using the built-in copy feature, or by exporting a checklist and importing it again later. If you have large project checklists that you use over and over again: here’s your sign!</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Are large checklists easy to manage?</span></p>
<p>CheckVist seems geared for larger projects. I’ve several outlines working (in my free account), some of which with well over a hundred items, and it hasn’t skipped a beat. Since, it’s a snap to open and close the outline items, it’s easy to get the big picture, and then drill down to the fine detail.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Can multiple authors edit a checklist?</span></p>
<p>Since CheckVist is primarily a brainstorming product, collaboration is a key use case. It’s easy to add additional authors to any of your CheckVists. As the original owner, you can always unshare the list with any of the other authors.</p>
<p>To help grease the rails of collaboration, CheckVist tracks of who edited a task, and can alert you whenever an update occurs.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Is “alpha” software safe to use?</span></p>
<p>Right now, CheckVist is labelled “alpha” software by its authors, and it’s only been in public use since August 2008. CheckVist has a very solid, professional feel to it, and I have no qualms about using it myself. Though, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>There are some glitches, mainly around latency when editing. Sometimes when I’m rewriting a task, the changes won’t display correctly while I’m making the change. But, as soon as it is saved, the task displays correctly.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I’ve had is with trying use the “undo” feature. Bluntly, CheckVist undo (as of this writing) is not ready for primetime. The feature tends to undo more than you would expect, and if you use it, you’ll probably regret it. Of course, if you’re used to using ctrl-z in other products, undo can be a hard habit to unlearn :(</p>
<p>Overall, I’ve been using it hard, and the only data I’ve lost was due to undo. Everyone has to decide for his or herself how scary is an “alpha” tag.<br><span style="font-size:130%;"><br>Who makes CheckVist?</span></p>
<p>If you are use of any of the fine JetBrains products, like IDEA or Resharper, you would take comfort in the knowledge that CheckVist is brought to us by two TeamCity developers, . According to the website, “”.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;">Is CheckVist right for me?</span></p>
<p>If you are looking for a decent online outlining tool, to use for checklists or brainstorming, then definitely take CheckVist for a spin. It may not replace your TODO list manager, but you might also get more done. :)</p>
<p>HTH, Ted.</p>

<p>Despite the backup CDs, and backup USB drive, she still worried that our digital photos would one day turn up missing. A few days before Christmas, a friend turned me onto Jungle Disk, an Amazon S3 application.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jungle Disk</a> makes using the Amazon cloud as easy as using a local disk drive. Simply install the client software (for Windows, Mac, or Linux) on your computer, like any other application. Sign up for an Amazon S3 account, and suddenly, you can backup up anything you like to the Amazon cloud.</p>
<p>What’s the cloud? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank" rel="external">Technically</a>, cloud computing is “An emerging computing paradigm where data and services reside in massively scalable data centers and can be ubiquitously accessed from any connected devices over the internet.” Colloquially, it’s using the web like a computer peripheral.</p>
<p>Raw storage on the Amazon cloud starts at $0.15 a gigabtye a month ($1.80 a year). The rate compares well to applications like Google Picasa. A free Picasa account comes with 1 GB of storage. For $20 a year, Google gives you 10 GB more. If we did need 10 GB of A3 storage, we’d be paying $18 a year. Meanwhile, Yahoo’s Flckr gives .1 GB (100 MB) to free accounts, and offers unlimited storage for $25 a year.</p>
<p>Of course, Jungle Disk and Flckr are very different applications. JD lets you backup or store any kind of file, just like it was a remote network drive. Flckr is restricted to photos, but lets you share those photos with anyone you like (in strange and marvelous ways).</p>
<p>There are two primary ways of using the Jungle Disk Desktop Edition– you can choose to use one or both of these options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The second option for using Jungle Disk is the automatic backup feature. The Automatic Backup feature allows you to keep files and folders on your local machine backed up automatically off-site to your Jungle Disk. If you mainly want to use your online storage space for backup, the Automatic Backup feature makes it easy and eliminates the need to copy files to your mapped drive manually on a regular basis or use 3rd party backup software. Once backed up with Automatic Backup, your files will also be available via the mapped drive.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily open or copy backed up files from your mapped drive back to your local machine. If you need to restore a large number of files to your machine you can also use the built-in Restore feature that allows you to select a large number of files and directories and restore them in a single operation. The restore feature also allows you to restore previous versions of files, which are stored in a special directory on your Jungle Disk.</p>
<p>JD does come with some startup costs. In addition to the storage costs, a small charge applies to every data transfer. Usually, the transfer fee is lost in the rounding, but if you upload several gig, it could add up to folding money. In my case, the first month’s bill from Amazon totaled a whopping thirty-two cents for uploading and storing 1.5 GB. Even better, I setup S3 to use my existing Amazon.com account, leaving me one less login to manage.</p>
<p>The only bump so far is that the Windows backup doesn’t run if the user is logged out. One workaround is to set the backup to try again as soon as it can. Then, the next time that login is used, the backup will launch. If you’re using incremental backup, it won’t be a noticeable performance hit.</p>
<p>Note that there’s a one time $20 charge for the JD client software. But, it’s a double saw buck well spent. Jungle Disk is quick and easy to use. The user interface is clean, and it’s very easy to indicate what files to backup, and how often to refresh the backup.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Jungle!</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><a href="http://google.com/a/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/20915-googleyeyes.png" alt=""></a>In a prior blog, I overview moving a personal site to Google Apps. Before taking the leap yourself, here’s a grab bag of gotcha’s and pleasant surprises.</p>
<p>Googley gotcha’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you do need a domain. :)</li>
<li>During the initial setup, I inadverently closed my Google Apps window while entering the CNAME changes. Eventually, I went back to , I was able to pickup where I left off. (The “a” is for “apps” – Google likes to use one-letter IDs when it can.)</li>
<li>The Mail and Chat services weren’t enabled by default. To enable additional services, look for the “Add more services” link hidden next to the Service Center heading.</li>
<li>Transferring the MX registration can take 24-48 hours, depending on your timing and your registrar.</li>
<li>The Google App accounts have their own login area . Trying to login using your domain at the standard account prompt won’t work.</li>
<li>Along the same vein, the Google Apps Account is separate from a regular Google Account. To access all that Google has to offer, you need both. (Happily, the cookies don’t conflict, and you can be logged into both accounts at once.)</li>
<li>The applications are useful and usable, but not truly ready for prime time, when compared to conventional suites, like OpenOffice, or Microsoft Office. The Sites can be especially frustrating. (Can you say “GeoCities”?)</li>
<li>While GA “Starter Pages”, iGoogle, and Blogger, all seem to utilize the same “Gadget” plugins, they seem to be using different code bases. It would be great if there were all shared between the three platforms.</li>
<li>The starter pages can be configured by anonymous users. Once a user has configured a start page, the administrator can’t push start page changes. (So, an anonymous start page isn’t a good fit as the domain welcome page.)</li>
<li>If you delete a page in a Google site, you can’t reuse the name. The site will stubbornly append a numeral to the end, so instead of having a new “Welcome” page, you end up with “Welcome2”.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Google Documents (which is different than a Google Site) don’t expose a shared folder structure. You can setup your own folders to organize documents, but no one else will see those folders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Calendar’s “Find Next Available Time” feature can be set to search only “Working Hours”, but you can’t configure the working hour span (it’s 8a to 6p, M-F, like it or not!).</li>
<li><p>Not all Google assets play well together. For example, I tend to draft blogs in Google Notebook first. Pasting directly from Notebook to Blogger generates some ugly HTML. I have sanitize the copy first by pasting from Notebook to Notepad to Blogger.<br>And some pleasant surprises:</p>
</li>
<li><p>While some application features are missing, and performance can be choppy, the collaboration features help pick up the slack.</p>
</li>
<li>If you source a new domain through a Google Apps vendor, the domain setup is pre-configured.</li>
<li>The Standard Version starts out with 200 user ceiling, and you can ask for more.</li>
<li>Any user can be deputised as an Administrator.</li>
<li>You can create additional CNAME records for quick access to different services, like calendar.yourdomain.com.</li>
<li>You can map Sites to addresses under your domain, so that the clumsy Google Apps link is not shown.</li>
<li>Gmail now lets you import mail (new or old) from other GMail accounts using POP (in case you already got one).</li>
<li>The Apps allow some quick-and-easy color and logo customiizations.</li>
<li>Individual assets can be shared with Google Accounts outside your domain (if the administrator doesn’t disable external sharing).</li>
<li>GMail handles rich text quite well, so you can paste a table from Word into an email.</li>
<li>The Calendar is easy to share with people outside your domain, like contractors.</li>
<li>The Premium Accounts ($50/user/year) also have access to free video conferencing!<br>And, of course, everyone in your domain still has access to all the other Google goodies, like Notebook, Blogger, Knol, and more .</li>
</ul>
<p>HTH, Ted.</p>

        <p><a href="http://google.com/a/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/2c414-google-apps.jpg" alt=""></a>Over the Thanksgiving weekend, I moved my personal website (<a href="http://www.husted.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">husted.com</a>) to <a href="http://google.com/a/" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Apps</a>. The GA move will save me website hosting fees (the Standard Edition is free), while providing me new services my plain old HTML site didn’t have. Since we also use GA at <a href="http://www.vandamme.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">VanDamme</a>, I’ll also have a familiar, seamless environment, whether at work or at home. The trade-off is that my website’s look and feel is harder to customize, but, after ten years without an overhaul, I’m ready for a change.</p>
<p>Google Apps refers to a set of Google “point” applications, which, when used together, can create a virtual workplace. In practice, Google Apps is the equivalent of Microsoft Office and Outlook. Google Apps is free and delivered over the web. There is nothing to install, and you can access your assets from a web browser anywhere on the Internet.</p>
<p>The applications in the Google Apps suite are</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Talk</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Docs (word processing, spreadsheets, presentations)</li>
<li>Start Page</li>
<li>Sites<br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mail </span>(aka GMail) is a popular email client, that many people may already use. Mail is the core of Google Apps and shares resources with Talk and Calendar.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Chat </span>(aka GTalk, aka Talk) is featureful instant messaging application, and includes handy voice mail and file transfer utilities. Talk is exposed through Mail, and stores chat transcripts as Mail messages.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Calendar </span>shares its contact list with Mail, making it easy to schedule appointments with other people in your organization. It’s also easy to overlay any other Google Calendars that might be part of your busy modern life. Mail will also scan messages, looking for items that you might want to add to Calendar. I can display my personal Husted dot Com calendar alongside my VanDamme calendar, without commingling appointments.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Docs </span>provides online editing of word processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. While not as powerful as offline equivalents, Google Docs offers powerful collaborative features that you won’t find elsewhere.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Start Page </span>(aka iGoogle) is an personalized portal lending instant access to other applications in the Google Apps suite.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sites </span>is a web page builder that can be used to create special-purpose project portals. You can create a basic web page with a WYSIWYG editor, or add special page types, like a filing cabinet or message center.</p>
<p>But, wait, there’s more: Apps can also integrate with applications hosted by the Google Apps Engine, among others.</p>
<p>Finally, the services are a la carte, and you can disable any you don’t want to use with your domain (including mail).</p>
<p>Moving a site over is relatively painless. To use Google Apps, you do need a domain – either one you already own or a new one (that Google will help you purchase at a discount). To move an existing domain to GA, you need access to the CNAME and MX records. (The Help center has articles with specific instructions for most domain registrars.) The CNAME record will route request for addresses like “www.your-domain.com” to the Google servers. The MX record will route your domain email</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to use a web site as a collaborative tool, either for home or a small office, give Google Apps a gander. As a suite, it’s far from perfect, but Google Apps is still solid and useful platform.</p>
