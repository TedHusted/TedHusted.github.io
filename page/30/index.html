        <p>Since client-side JavaScript is event-driven, Ajax libraries follow suit. For many developers, Ajax is their first time around the event-driven maypole.</p>
<p>When event-driven controls for the first time, it’s common for a noobe to attach some application-specific behavior to a control’s onClick event. As the application grows more complex, we often want to invoke the same behavior without the help of the control. A common question then becomes “How can we send the control a change event, as if the user had himself clicked on the option?” As with many programming problems, the solution is to add a layer of abstraction. :)</p>
<p>Instead of attaching our behavior directly to primitive events, like onClick, we should create our own idiomatic events to describe what happens when the user selects the option. Selecting the option is a means to an end. If we create own custom event for that end, the select control change event can turn around and raise our event. Then, when our custom event needs to be raised from another point in the workflow, we can just go ahead and raise it progmatically.</p>
<p>It’s not about clicking the control, it’s about the action that the control triggers.</p>
<p>In essence, user-interface widgets raise primitive events, like “change” and “click”. This is a Good Thing, because those events represent what widgets do (or appear to do). Applications don’t “click”. Applications update state and run reports. An event-driven application should create its own layer of idiomatic events that describes what the application does in its own terms. In that way, we are not chained to the controls, and we can call our own events whenever we like. Architectually, idiomatic events <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesive" target="_blank" rel="external">increase cohesion</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="external">lower coupling</a>. Also Good Things.</p>
<p>An excellent introduction to event-driven design is Christian Heilmann’s <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/17/event-plan/" target="_blank" rel="external">Event-Driven Web Application Design</a> (which I like to call “Brace yourself, Bridget!).</p>

        <p>There’s still the last mile to go, but at least the text for part one has reached its first full draft. Now, it’s down to fussing with the figures. :)</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sq1-struts2/" target="_blank" rel="external">GoogleCode site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apache Struts 2 from Square One is a training course designed for people who want to create Java web applications, not just quickly, but correctly. Training sessions include a technology primer and a coding exercise. This Project hosts materials used by the course including slide presentations, coding exercises, and a companion text book. The course can be used for independant study or in a classroom setting.<br><a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=googlecode" target="_blank" rel="external">As mentioned</a>, the course is something I developed over the years for Struts 1, and then adapted for WebWork 2, and now for Struts 2. The course itself is the usual “slides and labs” affair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Struts 2 from Square One is a textbook adaptation of the course. I’d like to print the text through <a href="http://lulu.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">LuLu.com</a> and include it as part of the course. If people want to use the textbook for individual homestudy, that’s fine too. Eventually, what I started at the <a href="http://www.strutsuniversity.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Struts University</a> site will be migrated to the Square One GoogleCode site.</p>
<p>With Struts 2 in GA mode, I’ll have a bit more time to work on this, but there’s no telling how long it will take to finish the other three parts. To an extent, how much effort I can put into the text depends on whether people engage me to <a href="http://www.strutsmentor.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">present the course</a> this year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49385&amp;package_id=223769&amp;release_id=490486" target="_blank" rel="external">an early release of the manuscript is available as a PDF</a>. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>Many Struts applications contain hundreds of pages. To help organize large applications, the Struts configuration is designed around the notions of “packages” and “namespaces”. Each package can set its own defaults, including a namespace setting.</p>
<p>/example/HelloWorld.jsp</p>
<p>Add actions here</p>
<p>Use the namespace attribute to create logical modules or units of work within an application, each with its own identifying prefix. In an accounting application, the actions relating to “payables” might be in one namespace, and actions relating to “receivables” in another.</p>
<p>Namespaces avoid conflicts between action names. Each namespace can have it’s own “menu” or “help” action, each with its own implementation. While the prefix appears in the browser URI, the tags are “namespace aware”, so the namespace prefix does not need to be embedded in forms and links.</p>

        <p>It’s official! WebWork is “worth” more than Struts 2! About 4x more! And they are both written “primarily in JavaScript”!</p>
<p>… at least according to the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">www.oloh.net</a> “Explore Open Source” website.</p>
<p>It seems that based on metrics like “lines of code”, the WebWork codebase is “worth” a wopping $7,849,557. Meanwhile, Struts 1 weighs in at a paltry $1,761,104. Struts 2 falls in between at $2,305,602.</p>
<p>Obviously, there’s something askew with the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/4312" target="_blank" rel="external">WebWork metric</a>. I expect it refers to WebWork 1, which included what is now XWork, and imported JavaScript libraries that the project didn’t code.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3562" target="_blank" rel="external">Struts 1 metrics</a> are also weird. Although the project is six years old, and we have the history of every commit from day one, Struts 1 is rated as having a short version control history. Stranger yet, Craig McClanahan is not listed as one of the contributors! That’s just not right. :)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3569" target="_blank" rel="external">Struts 2</a> contributor metrics seem about right, though the language metric doesn’t realize that most JavaScript libraries are imported rather than coded by the host project. But, I have to admit, the ohloh site design is pleasant, and it looks like they are trying to build a community around both contributors and other users. Given a sane set of metrics, ohloh would be interesting indeed. There’s a good number of projects onboard now, though a few are still missing, like <a href="http://www2.sqlonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">SQL on Rails</a> (don’t overlook the screencast!).</p>
<p>Another “fly on the wall of open source” project is <a href="http://www.sourcekibitzer.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">SourceKibitzer</a>. Rather than provide digital metrics, the Kibitzer specializes in trend reports. Evidentially, the idea is that we should choose open source projects using the same sort of charts we use to pick stocks (Buy!Buy!Buy!Ching!). Where ohloh offers metrics regarding lines of code, languages, licenses, and contributors, Kibitzer offers charts describing progress, completeness, complexity, and size.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I tried submitting similar statistics about Struts as part of an <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/struts/current/STATUS.txt?revision=51337&amp;view=markup" target="_blank" rel="external">ASF board report</a>. The numbers I collected related to the number of mailing list subscriptions, new posts, new issues, newly resolved issues, and total number of issues. At the board level, there was zero interest in this sort of thing. From the ASF perspective, so long as the interpersonal relationship between the PMC members is warm and fuzzy, the rest will take care of itself :)</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not only an ASF engineer, I’m an engineer, and, personally, I do like to see hard numbers. But, sites like ohloh and Kibitzer have to move beyond codebase analyses. To the user-only community, the things that matter are the mailing list and issue tracker. Kibitzer tries to track completeness by looking for semantic clues like “TODO” comments. In practice, we are far more likely to log TODOs in the issue tracker. While it’s interesting that so-and-so contributes a lot of code, to someone casing a project, it’s more interesting the so-and-so will answer my question on the mailing list.</p>
<p>In the same vein, it would also be important to analyze the project documentation. How many lines of text compared to how many lines of code? Is the wording complex? How many contributors? Are related books and articles being published outside of the project?</p>
<p>I suspect that the mailing list and issue tracker statistics might be more reliable than either code or documentation analysis. Compared with reality as we know it, much of the code-based analysis <a href="http://www.sucks-rocks.com/rate/struts2/tapestry/jsf/wicket/stripes" target="_blank" rel="external">seems dodgy</a>, and a dodgy statistic can worth less than Ted’s best guessimate at a release date :)</p>
