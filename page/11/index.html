<p><strong>The Secret Life of Open Source</strong></p>
<p>Apache, GNU, Mozilla, Ubuntu, PHP, LibreOffice, Wikipedia – Today, there are hundreds of open source groups, each with its own culture, methodology, and governance model.</p>
<ul>
<li>How are these groups alike?</li>
<li>How are they different?</li>
<li>Is there one true path to open source enlightenment, or do many paths converge around a common singularity?<br><strong>.NET at Apache.org</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Like it or not, many open source developers are moving to the Microsoft .NET platform, and we’re bringing our favorite tools with us! This session looks inside ASF projects that are creating software for .NET and Mono – like ActiveMQ, Chemistry, Logging, Lucene, QPid, and Thrift – and show how to create leading-edge ASP.NET applications with ASF open source libraries. We’ll also look at integrating other .NET open source projects, like Spring.NET, NVelocity, and JayRock, into your C# application to create a complete open source .NET stack.</p>
<p>Before joining NimbleUser, Ted consulted with teams throughout the United States, including CitiGroup, Nationwide Insurance, and Pepsi Bottling Group, and he is a regular speaker at ApacheCon and the Ajax Experience. Ted is also a former member of the Apache Struts project and co-founder of the Apache (Jakarta) Commons. His books include Google Wave (Preview) Explained, JUnit in Action, Struts in Action, and Professional JSP Site Design.</p>
<p>As a Business Analyst for NimbleUser, Ted concentrates on identifying business needs and crafting solutions that meet an organization’s goals, objectives, and budget. Locally, he also serves as VP of Finance for the Rochester Chapter of the International Institute for Business Analysis (IIBA).</p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Create and update fields en masse</strong> (Tom Patros)</span></p>
<p>Using the supremely helpful <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Force.com_IDE" target="_blank" rel="external">Force IDE</a> (an Eclipse plugin), Tom showed how easy it can be to mass edit fields properties via XML metadata. Developers already use the IDE to create and text Apex classes and triggers. Tom walked through how admins can use the IDE to quickly add or update custom fields by editing the XML metadata definitions the Force IDE generates. While easy to use, the Salesforce graphical user interface can become tedious when mass editing a set of fields, making editing via XML seem like a breath of fresh air. You can even manage picklist definitions by editing the metadata. For extra credit, Tom also demoed a Google spreadsheet that can be used to craft and document the schema, and then generate the definition to use with the IDE.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Connecting with SFDC API’s from Access</strong> (Bob Scott)</span></p>
<p>One of the most popular Salesforce admin tools is the <a href="http://www.nimbleuser.com/blog.aspx?id=3712&amp;blogid=236&amp;terms=excel+connector" target="_blank" rel="external">Excel connector</a> that makes it easy to manage Salesforce data directly from Excel. Bob Scott walked through how Access can be used to, well, access Salesforce data in much the same way. With a bit of elbow grease, you can update SFDC from an Access application, or update SFDC from Access.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Approval process simplified</strong> (Theresa Mason)</span></p>
<p>Often, an Opportunity or Quote needs to go through an approval process, and to make it through the gauntlet, certain fields must be completed. Getting users to remember which fields to fill out first can be a challenge, especially in the excitement of taking an opportunity to the next level. Theresa showed us how to add a validation to a checkbox, to trigger an automatic review of a record submitting it to an approval workflow. Great way to reduce many rules to one: Check the box and follow the instructions.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Synchronizer data mover</strong> (Rich Bilsback)</span></p>
<p>Synchronizer is a Microsoft Access database that helps you automate data tasks in Salesforce. Rich walked us through how he uses the Syncronizer to keep local application data updated, and how to use a local application to update your Salesforce data in the cloud. To get started, <a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N300000024ahkEAA" target="_blank" rel="external">grab the Synchronizer from the Sales Force AppExchange</a>. It’s a free “Aloha” application distributed by the Force.com Labs.</p>

What I like most about the habits is that they are a system. The habits are not a simple set of best practices, but a rich network of interrelated behaviors that reinforce one another.</p>
<p>Here’s the habits, which I like to remember in the form of a litany:</p>
<p>“Be proactive, begin with the end in mind, and put first things first. Seek first to understand then to be understood, think win-win, and synergize. Sharpen the saw, teach the habits, and introspect.”</p>
<p>There are three sets of behaviors within the habits: public, private, and renewal, which I express in the three sentences of the litany.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal: Be proactive, begin with the end in mind, and put first things first.</li>
<li>Public: Seek first to understand then to be understood, think win-win, and synergize.</li>
<li>Renewal: Sharpen the saw, teach the habits, and introspect.<br>Originally, there were seven habits, but after a while, Covey realized that there was a eighth habit, always implied, but not called out separately: “Teach the habits.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Ironically, Covey himself practiced “Teach the habits” by writing the original seven habits book, but had to go back and practice it once again in an “eighth habit” book.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the litany, there is added a ninth habit: <em>Introspect</em>.</p>
<p>In the Seven Habits, there is a key question that Covey asks us to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What is one thing you could do, that, if you did it on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in your personal or professional life?”<br>(Or: What am I not doing that I should be doing in order to be more effective?)</li>
</ul>
<p>In my mind, asking this question goes beyond a background process. The question helps us choose which jungles to harvest. I see “Introspection” as a separate habit, a final link in the chain. A thoughtful answer to the “regular-basis” question closes the loop and brings us back to Habit 1: <em>Be proactive</em>.</p>
<p>Brother Covey also numbers the public habits slightly differently than the order found in the litany. The canonical order for the public habits is “win-win”, “seek-first”, and “synergize” (4, 5, and 6). But, from a systems perspective, that order seems sideways to me.</p>
<p>The order of the personal habits (1, 2, 3) lead us from bootstrapping, into goal setting, and onto prioritization. Likewise, the public habits should lead us from empathy, into collaboration, and onto teamwork.</p>
<p>With the litany, I’m never stuck when someone asks me: Can you name the seven habits? The litany walks through the internal creation of an idea and its external manifestation, step by step.</p>
<p>Just don’t get me started on remembering the NATO AlphaBravo alphabet. :)</p>

When the current roadmap runs its course, there will be five ways to build Salesforce applications.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.salesforce.com/platform/appforce/" target="_blank" rel="external">Appforce</a> (classic Force.com) - <strong>Today </strong>- Appforce is the tried and true platform we use today, which combines Salesforce CRM, the force.com platform, and the VisualForce user interface library.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.salesforce.com/platform/siteforce/" target="_blank" rel="external">Siteforce</a> (web sites) - <strong>GA Summer 2010</strong> - Siteforce combines content managmement with database management to create compelling web sites, for internal or external use.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vmforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">VMForce</a> (enterprise Java apps) - <strong>GA in 2011</strong> - VMForce is SFDC’s partnership with VMWare to deliver an enterprise Java cloud.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Heroku</a> (Ruby apps) - <strong>Today </strong>- Heroku is an established, cloud-based Ruby web application platform, available through its own website.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.salesforce.com/platform/isvforce/" target="_blank" rel="external">ISVForce</a> (AppExchange) - <strong>Today </strong>- ISVForce provides the tools and technologies partners need to package applications for distribution.<br>Supporting the five development streams are two other products</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2010/12/101208-2.jsp" target="_blank" rel="external">RemedyForce</a> - <strong>Today </strong>- IT help desk.</li>
<li><a href="http://database.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Database.com</a> - <strong>Summer 2011</strong> - By providing a trusted database platform for any language and any device, Salesforce hopes to help more customers move enterprise applications to the cloud.<br>A key point is that Salesforce is providing a separate application platform and a separate database platform. Developers can use the platforms together, or mix-and-match with other platforms and services. You might host an ASP.NET application on your own server, or on Azure, but reach out to database.com for storage. Or you might host an application on Siteforce and reach out to your own web service for crucial data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile applications are a great fit for cloud based development tools. There is no app server running on your mobile device, but by reaching out to a cloud database, you can connect the mobile app to other people in your enterprise.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">More about Siteforce</span><br>The Siteforce mission to make the building and management of web sites dramatically easier. Technically, Salesforce is combining a cloud version of dreamweaver with a cloud web CMS with 24x7 hosting technology and an easy point-and-click, drag-and -drop design interface that non-techical people can use to build applications.</p>
<p>Developers can drag existing applications into the CMS and build templates that people can use to build websites. The Siteforce architecture will also provide different views for different devices, simplifying mobile support. Since people do not want their web sites subject to scheduled mainenance, Siteforce will use a different infrastructure that will sites to stay online 24x7x365.</p>
<p>Initially, the primary focus for SiteForce will be on marketing web sites, but the platform will be expanded to make building collaborative sites easier too. An open component architecture allows developers to build connections to the SFDC database and develop functionality like forums and wikis. Using the component architecture, Salesforce is expecting that the development community will provide a  wide array of custom Siteforce extensions and components through the AppExchange.</p>
<p>Siteforce also includes full support for VisualForce pages and integrated authentification with the customer service and platform portals. Salesforce is extending its offering to appeal to both code-driven and visual developers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">More about VMForce </span><br>The Saleforce vision for VMForce is simple: Give Java developers a path to the cloud so that they can run their enterprise applications on our services. Java developers can use their existing tools, using the SpringSource tools suite, based on Eclipse. Developers can deploy to our cloud service simply by dragging a WAR file onto a Salesforce server. Developers can also use Java JPA code and Java objects to connect to database.com. The focus is on the Spring Framework and standard Java (rather than the full J2EE stack). Apex and VisualForce are not going away – Salesforce is extending its offerings to appeal to a wider range of developers.<br><span style="font-size:large;"><br>Getting Started </span><br>While some of the new SFDC development offerings are a work in progress, you can get up and running with a free Force.com site today.
