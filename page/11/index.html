        <p><a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/%22" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Code</a> doesn’t seem to have release per se, or even announce when new features are added. Day by day, it just gets better and better.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the ninjas added to the automatic alerts. Yesterday, I was reviewing some issues and noticed that we can now edit all the issue details. Not long ago, the details were immutable. Now I can fix the issues inadvertently named “Enter one line summary”.</p>
<p>Here’s a run down of some other changes that I’ve noticed. Some of these may be older than others.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can now feature (or deprecate) wiki pages and downloads</li>
<li>We can mark an issue “notify me of issue changes”.</li>
<li>We can edit issue details.</li>
<li>There are now search filters for “My Issues”, “My Starred Issues”, and “Issues to Verify”, along with “All Issues” and “Open Issues”</li>
<li>Advanced issues search offers a “without the words” option, along with narrowing the search to labels, statuses, reporters, owners, and such.</li>
<li>The number of people who have starred an issue is tracked and reported (as an indication that they care).<br>One search filter that is missing is “Fixed” issues. The workaround for that is to enter the word “Fixed” into an all issues search. Ditto for “WontFix”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there is still miles to go. Right now, the four features that I miss most on Google Code are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=94" target="_blank" rel="external">JIRA/SVN style integration to support issue-driven-development</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=57" target="_blank" rel="external">Allow direct linking to issues from the wiki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=71" target="_blank" rel="external">ViewVC support</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=96" target="_blank" rel="external">Email notifications on changes to project setup</a><br>The “project setup notification” issue has been marked “Won’t Fix”, but hope springs eternal.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, even with these missing features, Google Code is still my favorite host, though admittedly because the tab interface makes everything so quick and easy to use.</p>
<p>Now, if we could just wrap Confluence, JIRA, Jive Forums, and (of course) Subversion in the same sort of interface, and get someone to set up a free open source hosting service – then we would really have <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=prim" target="_blank" rel="external">Team Best of Breed</a>!</p>

        <p>I’ve never been a logging enthusiast. Many of the frameworks I use put logging to good use, but it not something I’ve felt compelled to inject into my own applications.</p>
<p>Many coders use logging as a development aid. One of my earliest Turbo Pascal programs wrote a character to the menu bar as a “tell”. As the application moved through a workflow, the tell would change. If it hung up, I knew where to start looking. It started as a development aid, but I left it in the production code because, well, it looked cool!</p>
<p>For most developers, our desire to log takes seed with a quick write to standard out, and blossoms as world-class products like Log4J, Log4Net, Log4PHP, and the other flowers in the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apache Logging</a> bouquet.</p>
<p>Rather use loggers as a development aid, these days I tend to set a lot of breakpoints as I develop. I like to follow brother Steve McConnell’s advice from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619670/husteddotcom-20" target="_blank" rel="external">Code Complete</a>. Every time I write a new swatch of code, first, I set a breakpoint and watch it run.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Joe Hewitt’s brilliant <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank" rel="external">FireBug plugin</a> is one of my new best friends these days. Running a close second is the Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library’s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/logger/" target="_blank" rel="external">Logger</a>.</p>
<p>Like other implementations, the YUI Logger works as a singleton, so it’s very easy to write a logging message from anywhere in the application.</p>
<pre><code>// Assigns default category &quot;info&quot; and default source &quot;global&quot;
YAHOO.log(&quot;My log message&quot;); `&lt;/pre&gt;
As implied by the comment, we can add categories and source parameters to the method call, which are also standard fare for logging systems.

The trick with JavaScript logging is viewing the messages. Most of the Apache Logging bunch rely on logging to console or to a shared file for the application. Some browsers do support a JavaScript console window, but it&apos;s not a standard feature. For JavaScript, we need to shift the paradigm.

But it&apos;s not such a big shift. Since YUI is a widget library, it would make sense to express the Logger Control (or LogReader) as a widget. To view the messages as they are logged, just add the LogReader widget to an application, again with one whole line of code.
&lt;pre&gt;`var myLogReader = new YAHOO.widget.LogReader(); `&lt;/pre&gt;
By default, the LogReader widget plants itself in the top right corner of the browser window. If that arrangement doesn&apos;t work for you, the widget can also be attached to a div or dragged around the screen. If the window box still feels cluttered, there a builtin &quot;Collapse&quot; button. To be even more unobtrusive, you can add your own button to show or hide the widget.

An especially good use of logging in a JavaScript application is to document when events fire. Widgets raise primitive events like &quot;click&quot;. A well-designed application will handle those events and raise an &quot;idiomatic&quot; event of its own. We can rely on the widget to raise its event, the interesting bit is when we raise our own.

Case in point, we&apos;re working on a DataForm widget that can share a RecordSet and ColumnSet with a YUI DataTable. The form widget raises &quot;update&quot; and &quot;insert&quot; events for the benefit of a client controller application. In early testing of the widget, we can&apos;t see those events happen, because they haven&apos;t been wired to a client yet. But, we can use a logger to view the events as they are raised.
&lt;pre&gt;`oSelf.fireEvent(&quot;updateEvent&quot;,context);
oSelf.logRecordEvent(&quot;updateEvent&quot;, oRecord, oOldRecord); // debug
</code></pre><p>Where logRecordEvent is a helper method that expresses the oRecord and oOldRecord data in human-readable JSON.</p>
<p>We could also set breakpoints to check that the events fire, and the first time around, we still do. But, the logging statements are also a rudimentary unit test. In fact, the next step might be to create Selenium tests that look for logging statements on our example pages.</p>
<p>The YUI library distribution includes *-debug version of all the modules that include this kind of logging statement. The production version has the logging statement extracted. (Leaving a few strange lines of code behind, like empty else statements.)</p>
<p>Of course, there would be a few ways to filter production code for logging statements. <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/11598" target="_blank" rel="external">I don’t know what YUI does</a>, but for my own projects, I might try an <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=aptana" target="_blank" rel="external">Aptana</a> action to do the dirty work.</p>
<p>Though, since the LogReader can be flipped on and off, it’s not hard to imagine leaving some statements embedded, for the sake of technical support. So, for now, we’re marking the logging lines “// debug” in case we decide to leave some in later.</p>
<p>I may never love logging quite as much as Ceki, but the YUI LogReader is at least a friend with benefits!</p>

        <p>As much as I enjoy blogging through JRoller, I thought I’d spend the month of April taking other blogging systems for a spin. I’ll let each trial run for a week, but to keep it sane, I’ll continue to archive each blog to the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted" target="_blank" rel="external">JRoller page</a>.</p>
<p>First in line is <a href="http://www.simplephpblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Simple PHP Blog</a>. This isn’t a blogging site, like JRoller, Blogger, or 360. It’s a PHP script that a can be installed on a conventional server for a single user.</p>
<p>Installing Simple PHP Blog is, well, simple. Upload the script, set the permissions, and run the index.php. With <a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">FileZilla</a>, it can all be done using drag, drop, and click.</p>
<p>Since SPB is intended for people with server access, there isn’t an editing feature for the themes. But, if you were able to install SPB, it’s not any harder to edit the file and drop it onto the server. In practice, it’s no different than editing a Roller theme.</p>
<p>One nice feature is the sidebar text box widget. To get an “About Me” blurb into JRoller, I had to edit the theme. With SPB, I could just add a text box through the configuration menu that comes up in the sidebar. On the website, the developer is testing a new widget feature, to make it easier to add other customizations to the sidebar.</p>
<p>One nice thing for me is that SPB generates arbitrary permalinks IDs. JRoller used a hash of the name, which induced me to use my own hash for the title, save the entry, and then change the title to be human-friendly.</p>
<p>SPB uses a BBS code markup for the entries and comments. Instead of using HTML tags like , we use pidgin tags like [url=][/url]. There’s a wizard for building the tags, but once you’ve seen an example, they are just as easy to create by hand.</p>
<p>Eventually, I’ll probably do a feature grid. For now, it seems like SPB has rounded up all the “usual suspect” features, at least in the context of a single-user blog installed on your own server. The next question will be whether my server is any more reliable than JRoller’s :)</p>
<p>To access the blog system of the week, follow the <a href="http://husted.com/ted/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://husted.com/ted/blog/index.html</a>. Feel free to re-up for the feed, so as to give each system a fair test. Of course, if anyone has a preference or other feedback, feel free to comment.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve always been a die-hard IDEA fan. Jetbrains says “Develop with pleasure,” and they mean it! Even with Eclipse and NetBeans nipping at their heels, Jetbrains has managed to stay ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>But, for Ajax applications, <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Aptana</a> is poised to give Jetbrains a run for its money.</p>
<p>Being an Eclipse application, Aptana already has a huge headstart. The JavaScript editor is augmented with all the features you would expect: code assist on CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, FTP support, and a JavaScript debugger to troubleshoot your code. The Aptana IDE also includes features you might not expect, like being extensible via macros ad actions writtnen in (yes!) JavaScript. There’s also a very cool outline perspective (which I wished I had found sooner!). (Hint: Dock the Project and Outline perspectives with FastView.)</p>
<p>For a quick tour of key features, scope the <a href="http://aptana.com/screenshots.php" target="_blank" rel="external">screenshots</a> page.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Aptana is all about Ajax. For example, the project wizard will setup the Ajax libraries of your choice (or at least any of the top nine: AFLAX, Dojo, jQuery, MochKit, Prototype, Rico, Scriptaculous, YUI, and/or yui-ext). Being a good open source citizen, Aptana uses other OS products under the covers, including JS Lint and FireBug. A special bonus is that the <a href="http://aptana.com/documentation.php" target="_blank" rel="external">project documentation</a> includes a most excellent CSS/HTML/JavaScript reference useful to anyone developing AJax with any editor on any platform.</p>
<p>Quirks? There are a few. After three days, the debugging still isn’t working for me. Just to be a tease, it did work once, and it worked brilliantly, but then stopped as suddenly as it started. With two monitors, Aptana and standalone FireBug work well together. (But standalone FireBug works well with anything!)</p>
<p>There is also an “Open Declaration” feature that works only sometimes for me too. But Aptana is young, and open source, and these things are sure to sort themselves out.</p>
<p>For straight-up Java/Ajax development, I expect that IDEA still has the edge. But, for anything else, IDEA’s predilection for Java shows, and you’re developing against the grain.</p>
<p>Although Aptana is based on Eclipse, and uses an embeded Jetty server for native debugging, it shows no favoritism to Java. Developers working in Ruby, PHP, C#, et cetera, are made to feel right at home.</p>
<p>In fact, a Ruby RAD environment seems to be an Aptana endgame. The RadRails IDE is being built over Aptana. Once Rails.net is ready for primetime, I expect that RadRails is going to draw me towards the light :)</p>
<p>I’ve only been using Aptana for a week. I haven’t spent much time in the forum, and I’m still not sure of the project’s motivation. The site mentions that Aptana is funded by venture capital, but I don’t know what revenue stream is projected. I expect they could turn around and sell it, which is fine with me. People pay me, and I don’t mind paying other people. Or, it may all be to promote a consulting business that will put the IDEs to good use. I really don’t know yet.</p>
<p>But for the code I’m developing now, it’s saving me time over using Visual Studio with Resharper. The code/test cycle is very quick, and I don’t have to worry about running JS Lint. Aptana handles those types of syntax errors as we edit. I filed a ticket about improving the Resharper JavaScript support, but, evidentially, that’s not going to happen any time soon. Resharper is focussed on C# 3.0 support, and JavaScript is on the back burner.</p>
<p>A key Aptana edge is that it’s based on Eclipse, opening the door to other Eclipse plugins. There is a <a href="http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/#features" target="_blank" rel="external">C# plugin for Eclipse</a>, and between iterations, I’ll have to give it a try. If the C# plugin works well enough, or we can make it so, we might be able to sideline Visual Studio all together.</p>
<p>I enjoy using VS with Resharper, but we often code against the Visual Studio grain. If Resharper is not going to improve JavaScript editing, I might finally be lured away from Jetbrains.</p>
<p>In the end, I think Aptana might just become the “Ajax IDE for the rest of us”. :</p>

        <p>A key reason we were able to use the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" target="_blank" rel="external">Yahoo User Interface (YUI) Library</a> is that the latest release includes a DataTable widget. Our application design uses lots of grids. Of course, there are grids from other toolkits and libraries that we could have used. But, honestly, we would have standardized on that toolkit instead.</p>
<p>Of course, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/" target="_blank" rel="external">YUI DataTable</a> is new and beta and not without its shortcomings. But, every time I found a flaw, I also cobbled a patch (and filed a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5208774" target="_blank" rel="external">ticket</a>).</p>
<p>Looking at our design, what we do over and over again is Find, List, Edit, and View. The entity we want to Find/List/Edit/View changes, but the core workflow holds.</p>
<p>We did the last application module in ASP.NET. Most workflows were represented as pages that exposed one or more composite controls. Much of the page logic involved deciding which controls needed to be exposed.</p>
<p>For the YUI module, I’d like to have a single “chimera” widget that can reveal itself four or five different ways. As a Finder (QBE Dialog), as a Lister (DataGrid), as an Editor (Data Entry Form), as a Lister (View Only Panel), and as both a Lister and Finder in the same view. Behind the scense, the DataTable (Lister) is powered by <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/ColumnSet.html" target="_blank" rel="external">ColumnSet</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/RecordSet.html" target="_blank" rel="external">RecordSet</a> objects, which could also power a Finder, Editor, and Viewer.</p>
<p>For now, I’m referring to this as a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/anvil/issues/detail?id=22" target="_blank" rel="external">FLEV Widget</a>, and I’ve started coding it through the Anvil site.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another earnest YUI user <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/11247" target="_blank" rel="external">posted a DataTable subclass</a> that adds filtering on a column and hiding columns. Nice work, and a fine demonstrate of how easy it is to extend YUI widgets.</p>
<p>Since YUI doesn’t accept contributions from the user community, I wonder if we should setup a community site on SourceForge or GoogleCode, where we could contribute and jointly maintain extensions like FLEV and RowFilterDataTable.</p>
<p>The idea would be that anyone with code to contribute would be welcome to join the site. Since widgets are granular, we could each retain our own copyrights to the original widgets, and just use the site as a one-stop shop for YUI extensions.</p>
<p>Of course, there is already a <a href="http://www.yui-ext.com/deploy/yui-ext/docs/" target="_blank" rel="external">YUI-Ext project</a>, but that has evolved into a distinct library that supports both YUI and JQuery, and I expect other libraries one day. And YUI Ext was never a full-throttle open source project, it was always Jack Slocum’s baby.</p>
<p>The Yahoo! team has built a cathedral. Perhaps it’s time to open a companion bazaar – a yazaar! :)</p>

        <p>I have no idea why JIRA, Confluence, and Subversion are still separate products. (Well, being a working engineer I do have at least an idea …)</p>
<p>In practice, most of us use JIRA, Confluence, and Subversion as if they were one product. (A rich man’s <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Trac</a>.) I’d like to be able to refer to using all three products together as “Convergence”, but that would be confusing, since it sounds too much like a real product. There’s the hollywood hybrid approach, but terms like “JirFlusion” or “ConVera” or “SuJiCo” seem distracting. Let’s just go with a simple acronym, like JCS.</p>
<p>At work, we use JCS for everything. When we are ready to do something, anything, we open a <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/" target="_blank" rel="external">JIRA</a> ticket. If it’s a coding task, the ticket will relate to a Use Case that we create in <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/" target="_blank" rel="external">Confluence</a>, which will link back to the JIRA ticket. When we commit the bits to <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/" target="_blank" rel="external">Subversion</a>, we reference the JIRA ticket, and the <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAEXT/JIRA+Subversion+plugin" target="_blank" rel="external">JIRA-Subverson plugin</a> closes the loop.</p>
<p>In these days of “<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" target="_blank" rel="external">TeamCity</a>“ and “<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Team System</a>“, we like to think of JCS as “Team Best of Breed”, especially when you toss JetBrains IDEA or Resharper into the mix.</p>
<p>But, issue tracking, document management, and version control aren’t just for coders. Other workers in the enterprise been using it to draft grant proposals and evaluate accessibility compliance. These are products that any information worker can (and should) use.</p>
<p>At work, one of our more ambitious Confluence applications is the infrastructure documentation. I spent the last week of last year’s contract dumping everything I knew about our infrastructure into Confluence. We ended up finding another contract for me after that, and another one after that, but at the time, I wanted to be sure the team had a solid reference.</p>
<p>Of course, a problem with putting software documentation into software is that you need software to use the software that tells you how to install the software. Happily, between the <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/AutoExport+for+Confluence" target="_blank" rel="external">Confluence autoexport plugin</a> and SpiderZilla, that’s not a problem. The autoexport plugin renders the Confluence wiki as plain text, and the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1616/" target="_blank" rel="external">FireFox SpiderZilla plugin</a> sucks it down to a local machine. <a href="http://husted.com/archive/WQD-INF/" target="_blank" rel="external">Here’s the result</a>, no server required.</p>
<p>The fully-loaded “Team Best of Breed” doesn’t stop at JCS. Clever shops will also want to install <a href="http://viewvc.tigris.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">ViewVC</a>, so that prior Confluence revision logs and diffs are only a click away. ViewVC means adding Apache HTTPD to the mix, but it’s worth the effort. (And HTTPD makes a good host for exported Confluence spaces!)</p>
<p>A developers mailing list with an archive is the final, but perhaps most important, team member. Each component of JCS can send change alerts to a list, to keep everyone in the loop with no extra effort. JCS doesn’t include an actual mailing list, but Confluence can be used as an <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5208774" target="_blank" rel="external">archive</a>.</p>
<p>Taken together, I like to think of these products as creating a PRIM architecture: Portal - Repository - Issue Tracker - Mailing List. Every successful open source project I know uses PRIM. Every closed source project I know, doesn’t. (Well, except mine!) Many will use two or three of the four components, but most teams will wobble on the mailing list. In practice, an archived mailing list is essential. A list ties the other components together, creating a coherent communications system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s truly beyond me why more product managers don’t insist on an archived development mailing list. It’s the best way to keep track of what everyone is doing. You can just sit back, watch the emails come in from JIRA, Confluence, and Subversion, and know exactly who is doing what and what they plan to do next.<br>People wonder how open source projects manage to create high-quality products without managers or accountability. The answer: we’re accountable to our infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PRIM is the open source secret sauce.</p>

        <p>Over the years, there’s been a steady trend within Microsoft example applications. The trend has been away from what Java geeks calls Model 1 and toward Model 2 development. It’s been a forced, dragged-by-the-hair trend. At every step, the architect seems to be looking for alternatives to MVC/Model 2, and every time, the alternative comes up short, and the next iteration is one step closr to Java-style MVC.</p>
<p>The trend is clear if you spend a day reviewing the various ASP.NET application that were developed for ASP.NET 1.x. The trend is even more evident in ASP.NET 2.X. The platforms now offers an actual business logic component that can also be used to separate the data access code from the rest of the application. The only problem is that the component is still embedded in the web application, and, as far as I can tell, these “business logic” components can’t be tested outside of the web application. Though, it is most definitely another baby step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Rumor now has it that Microsoft is ready for another step toward MVC/Model 2. In his CodeBetter blog, Jeffrey Palmero outlines a new feature that Scott Guthrie is supposedly developing for the next generation of ASP.NET.</p>
<p><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/03/16/Big-News-_2D00_-MVC-framework-for-ASP.NET-in-the-works-_2D00_-level-300.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">According to the blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>A url might look like <a href="http://localhost/myApp/ShoppingCart.mvc/CheckOut" target="_blank" rel="external">http://localhost/myApp/ShoppingCart.mvc/CheckOut</a> where ShoppingCart is the Controller class and “CheckOut” is a method like:</p>
<pre><code>[Action]
public void CheckOut(){
 //do so
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>The MVC model can be used with regular control-based pages. The url determines the handler that’s activated, so it can be mixed an matched. In fact, a Controller could dispatch a view that <em>uses</em> some controls. i.e. Telerik controls could still be used without Telerik modifying them. From what I saw, no capabilities are taken away, just more options are added.</p>
<p>In this prototype, the controller loads the appropriate view by relative path to the .aspx. The view can be only markup - pure template, or it can take advantage of controls. This can work without postbacks, or you can use postbacks if you prefer.</p>
<p>The view has to inherit from PageView or if it needs properties from the controller (like the Model to display), it can inherit from PageView where T is the type of the controller it depends on. Then the view can grab specific properties off of the controller.</p>
<p>I would recommend making “T” an interface so that the view doesn’t bind directly to the controller type. I’ve been collaborating with Scott Guthrie to work out the kinks. There is still a lot of work to do. This is only in prototype form.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, Microsoft has been warming up to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998516.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">MVC and front controllers</a> patterns for some time. This is not <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa478961.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">the first time we’ve heard that MVC or front controller will be in the “next” version of ASP.NET</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, not to worry. If Microsoft comes out with a MVC technology, we will do what we always do … reinvent it as a JSR.</p>
