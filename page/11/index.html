        <p>A secret to the success of Salesforce CRM is how easy it is to customize and extend. Out of the box, Salesforce provides new users with a world-class framework for enabling collaboration between staff members and customers, or between staff and staff, or even between customers and customers (if you dare!). If that wasn’t enough, Salesforce provides a variety of ways to tailor your instance of the framework, so that it fits your own processes like a glove. </p>
<p>When folks first implement Salesforce, it’s easy to get carried away. Salesforce CRM can do so much, it’s tempting (but not practical) to try and do everything at once. In fact, Salesforce.com recommends that people spread out customization plans, so that refinement becomes an ongoing process. </p>
<p>Happily, two of the many Salesforce extensions include a project tracking app called “<a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000005tvt6EAA" target="_blank" rel="external">Milestones PM</a>“ and a change tracking app called “<a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N300000016ct3EAA" target="_blank" rel="external">ChangeIt</a>“. You can use Milestones PM to organize implementation projects, and ChangeIt to gather and prioritize new change requests. Both can be installed into your environment from the <a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/home" target="_blank" rel="external">Salesforce AppExchange</a>, free of additional charge.</p>
<p><strong>Milestones PM</strong></p>
<p>Milestones PM is an elegant approach to project tracking that makes it easy to capture and follow a classic work breakdown structure. It’s a great fit for IT projects, but the app would work just as well for any type of task-based project, such as organizing a retreat, publishing a newsletter, or planning an office move. </p>
<p>The application uses six objects to track progress: Project, Log, Milestone, Task, Time, and Expense, as shown in the illustration.</p>
<p><a href="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/9ef16-6a00d8341cded353ef014e5f4794a0970c-pi.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/9ef16-6a00d8341cded353ef014e5f4794a0970c-pi.png?w=300" alt=""></a><strong>Project</strong> is the top-level container for the other five objects. Aside from tracking key details – like a Kick-Off Date, Deadline, and Description – a Project contains a set of Milestones, along with an optional Log records.</p>
<p><strong>Logs</strong> are generic memo records that you can attach to a Project, Task, Time, or Expense record. Logs can be used to capture any miscellaneous detail that doesn’t fit neatly into the other fields. </p>
<p><strong>Milestones</strong> are the key organizing object within a project. To be useful, a Project must contain at least one Milestone record, which in turn can contain Task, Time, or Expense records. Milestones can have their own Kickoff and Deadline Dates, and be linked to Parent, Predecessor, or Successor Milestones. While not as featureful as Microsoft Project dependencies, good use of the Parent, Predecessor, and Successor Milestone groupings can make complex projects easier to understand and navigate. </p>
<p>The backbone of any project are the <strong>Tasks</strong>. Every Task must have a Name and be assigned to a Milestone, and can also track an Assignee, Start and Due Dates, statuses like Priority (0-4), Stage (In progress, Resolved, Closed) and Class (Ad Hoc, Defect, Rework), Estimates, and other properties. </p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> and <strong>Expense</strong> records can be attached to Tasks, which are tallied as part of the Project’s overall metrics. </p>
<p><a href="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/17a07-mpm-dashboard.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/17a07-mpm-dashboard.png?w=300" alt=""></a>As shown in the screen shot, Milestones PM makes excellent use of native Salesforce metrics, and integrates with other native features like Chatter and Calendar It also supports batch operations based on views and comes bundled with two dozen ready-to-run Reports.</p>
<p>Even better, Milestones PM is an <a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/results?filter=9&amp;sort=6&amp;type=Apps" target="_blank" rel="external">Aloha App</a>, so it doesn’t count against the number of tabs or objects your Salesforce instance consumes.</p>
<p><strong>ChangeIT</strong></p>
<p>Like housework, a good Salesforce implementation is never done. The platform is so flexible and so deep, there will always be ways to make it work even better for your users. The ChangeIT application provides a vehicle for tracking new features and fixes (which you could then turn into Milestone PM tasks).</p>
<p>In a nutshell, ChangeIT provides a simple way to manage changes to your Salesforce instance, and to notify team members when changes are scheduled or implemented. It also helps coordinate change requests, so developers and administrators are not stepping on each other.</p>
<p><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/5f96e-changeit.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/5f96e-changeit.png?w=300" alt=""></a></div>The application provides a single, simple tab with a form for making change requests, as shown in the illustration.</p>
<p>Saving the initial request triggers an approval workflow to the individuals that you set up. Once the initial request is approved or denied, the request can be worked on by developers or administrators (and/or transferred to Milestones PM). The application also includes a dashboard and supporting reports to view the pipeline of request changes. </p>
<p>Since the applications are independent, you can use either or both – your instance, your choice!</p>
<p>We’re always exploring better approaches to project tracking, with applications like Basecamp, Tom’s Planner, JIRA, and OnTime. Do you have a favorite tool? What features do you love? What features do you miss?</p>

<p><strong>The Secret Life of Open Source</strong></p>
<p>Apache, GNU, Mozilla, Ubuntu, PHP, LibreOffice, Wikipedia – Today, there are hundreds of open source groups, each with its own culture, methodology, and governance model.</p>
<ul>
<li>How are these groups alike?</li>
<li>How are they different?</li>
<li>Is there one true path to open source enlightenment, or do many paths converge around a common singularity?<br><strong>.NET at Apache.org</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Like it or not, many open source developers are moving to the Microsoft .NET platform, and we’re bringing our favorite tools with us! This session looks inside ASF projects that are creating software for .NET and Mono – like ActiveMQ, Chemistry, Logging, Lucene, QPid, and Thrift – and show how to create leading-edge ASP.NET applications with ASF open source libraries. We’ll also look at integrating other .NET open source projects, like Spring.NET, NVelocity, and JayRock, into your C# application to create a complete open source .NET stack.</p>
<p>Before joining NimbleUser, Ted consulted with teams throughout the United States, including CitiGroup, Nationwide Insurance, and Pepsi Bottling Group, and he is a regular speaker at ApacheCon and the Ajax Experience. Ted is also a former member of the Apache Struts project and co-founder of the Apache (Jakarta) Commons. His books include Google Wave (Preview) Explained, JUnit in Action, Struts in Action, and Professional JSP Site Design.</p>
<p>As a Business Analyst for NimbleUser, Ted concentrates on identifying business needs and crafting solutions that meet an organization’s goals, objectives, and budget. Locally, he also serves as VP of Finance for the Rochester Chapter of the International Institute for Business Analysis (IIBA).</p>

<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Create and update fields en masse</strong> (Tom Patros)</span></p>
<p>Using the supremely helpful <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Force.com_IDE" target="_blank" rel="external">Force IDE</a> (an Eclipse plugin), Tom showed how easy it can be to mass edit fields properties via XML metadata. Developers already use the IDE to create and text Apex classes and triggers. Tom walked through how admins can use the IDE to quickly add or update custom fields by editing the XML metadata definitions the Force IDE generates. While easy to use, the Salesforce graphical user interface can become tedious when mass editing a set of fields, making editing via XML seem like a breath of fresh air. You can even manage picklist definitions by editing the metadata. For extra credit, Tom also demoed a Google spreadsheet that can be used to craft and document the schema, and then generate the definition to use with the IDE.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Connecting with SFDC API’s from Access</strong> (Bob Scott)</span></p>
<p>One of the most popular Salesforce admin tools is the <a href="http://www.nimbleuser.com/blog.aspx?id=3712&amp;blogid=236&amp;terms=excel+connector" target="_blank" rel="external">Excel connector</a> that makes it easy to manage Salesforce data directly from Excel. Bob Scott walked through how Access can be used to, well, access Salesforce data in much the same way. With a bit of elbow grease, you can update SFDC from an Access application, or update SFDC from Access.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Approval process simplified</strong> (Theresa Mason)</span></p>
<p>Often, an Opportunity or Quote needs to go through an approval process, and to make it through the gauntlet, certain fields must be completed. Getting users to remember which fields to fill out first can be a challenge, especially in the excitement of taking an opportunity to the next level. Theresa showed us how to add a validation to a checkbox, to trigger an automatic review of a record submitting it to an approval workflow. Great way to reduce many rules to one: Check the box and follow the instructions.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Synchronizer data mover</strong> (Rich Bilsback)</span></p>
<p>Synchronizer is a Microsoft Access database that helps you automate data tasks in Salesforce. Rich walked us through how he uses the Syncronizer to keep local application data updated, and how to use a local application to update your Salesforce data in the cloud. To get started, <a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N300000024ahkEAA" target="_blank" rel="external">grab the Synchronizer from the Sales Force AppExchange</a>. It’s a free “Aloha” application distributed by the Force.com Labs.</p>

What I like most about the habits is that they are a system. The habits are not a simple set of best practices, but a rich network of interrelated behaviors that reinforce one another.</p>
<p>Here’s the habits, which I like to remember in the form of a litany:</p>
<p>“Be proactive, begin with the end in mind, and put first things first. Seek first to understand then to be understood, think win-win, and synergize. Sharpen the saw, teach the habits, and introspect.”</p>
<p>There are three sets of behaviors within the habits: public, private, and renewal, which I express in the three sentences of the litany.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal: Be proactive, begin with the end in mind, and put first things first.</li>
<li>Public: Seek first to understand then to be understood, think win-win, and synergize.</li>
<li>Renewal: Sharpen the saw, teach the habits, and introspect.<br>Originally, there were seven habits, but after a while, Covey realized that there was a eighth habit, always implied, but not called out separately: “Teach the habits.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Ironically, Covey himself practiced “Teach the habits” by writing the original seven habits book, but had to go back and practice it once again in an “eighth habit” book.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the litany, there is added a ninth habit: <em>Introspect</em>.</p>
<p>In the Seven Habits, there is a key question that Covey asks us to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What is one thing you could do, that, if you did it on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in your personal or professional life?”<br>(Or: What am I not doing that I should be doing in order to be more effective?)</li>
</ul>
<p>In my mind, asking this question goes beyond a background process. The question helps us choose which jungles to harvest. I see “Introspection” as a separate habit, a final link in the chain. A thoughtful answer to the “regular-basis” question closes the loop and brings us back to Habit 1: <em>Be proactive</em>.</p>
<p>Brother Covey also numbers the public habits slightly differently than the order found in the litany. The canonical order for the public habits is “win-win”, “seek-first”, and “synergize” (4, 5, and 6). But, from a systems perspective, that order seems sideways to me.</p>
<p>The order of the personal habits (1, 2, 3) lead us from bootstrapping, into goal setting, and onto prioritization. Likewise, the public habits should lead us from empathy, into collaboration, and onto teamwork.</p>
<p>With the litany, I’m never stuck when someone asks me: Can you name the seven habits? The litany walks through the internal creation of an idea and its external manifestation, step by step.</p>
<p>Just don’t get me started on remembering the NATO AlphaBravo alphabet. :)</p>
