To keep our own software projects on track, at NimbleUser we work toward five core milestones: Charter, Survey, Plan, Specify, and Correct.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Charter</span></p>
<p>“For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?”</p>
<p>Before beginning any project, the first step should be to pull together a proposed budget and adopt a project charter. The budget doesn’t have to be accurate, but it does need to indicate the magnitude of what we are setting out to do. What are the key objectives? How much might achieving each of those objectives cost? What is the total project investment, from requirements to implementation through deployment? The initial budget only needs to be a ballpark estimate that we can refine through analysis.</p>
<p>The project charter lays out the decision making process, and the overall analysis and implementation workflow. It calls out the participant roles and responsibilities, and clarifies expectations, so that we can keep the project on track and on budget.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Survey</span></p>
<p>“The only stupid question is the one you don’t ask”.</p>
<p>A simple stakeholder survey is a great way to kickoff a project. Depending on the circumstances, participants can work on the survey independently, or you can step through the questions at a meeting. Ideally, do we both. We provide the survey to participants in advance of a review meeting, and then we walk through the responses, to elicit any missing detail, and to discuss any “interesting” points. A survey document is also a great place to capture any unexpected material. If one question leads to another, we edit the survey (then and there) to capture new details.</p>
<p>If meeting remotely, we use a service like GotoMeeting to collaborate on the document in real time, or use a realtime sharing environment like Google Docs.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Plan</span></p>
<p>Sage advice is to never hold a meeting without an agenda, and to never kick-off a project without a plan.</p>
<p>Based on the preliminary proposal and detail elicited in the survey, a great next step is to outline the project, mapping business goals to the actual materials and services to be delivered. Then, using the preliminary proposal as a baseline, we separate the original items from any that were added or subtracted during the survey talks, or other discussions, so everyone can see how the scope is changing.</p>
<p>As with the survey, we like to present and review the outline using GotoMeeting or another collaboration environment, making realtime updates to the document during the review. The take away is to stay nimble by avoiding intermediary forms. To keep the outline clean, leave the gritty details in the survey document. It’s a good idea to reference the survey from the outline, so everyone knows it exists, but it’s not a good idea to dump minutia into the outline.</p>
<p>The outline should be a high-level treatment without implementation detail. A good analogy is a book proposal. Before chapter one is ever written, a publisher will want to see an outline of the entire book. Later, when the book is approved, and all the chapters in the outline are written, proofed, and typeset, then we know the book is done!</p>
<p>Following common practice, it’s a good idea to embed the outline in a high-level business plan document. (We call ours the “Discovery” document.) Since the plan lays out the key deliverables, we can use it to better estimate the size and cost of the project. Later, the items in the outline become tasks in a project plan, or stories in a scrum backlog.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Specify</span></p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the project, the next step is to develop a technical specification, or to work directly on the client’s system or development system.</p>
<p>If we are building a conventional web site, a low-level specification is needed to be sure we understand how all the pages work, and how they work together. A great way to keep a web site specification more interesting and collaborative is to use one of the new cloud-based wireframing tools, like ProtoShare or MockFlow.</p>
<p>If we are working with a turnkey system, like iMIS Public Views, we may walk through configuring the software interactively, rather than create a (mostly redundant) formal specification. Likewise, for a complete but customizable platform, like Salesforce, we may setup a project “jumpstart” and collaborate on the system configuration and customizations, live and direct.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Correct</span></p>
<p>It’s been said that “change is the only constant”. No matter how well we plan and specify a project, changes will occur during the implementation and even after the initial launch. When changes occur, we update the system specification. If we documented a feature in one way, but after testing, implemented it another way, then we correct the specification to reflect what happened. If a document is worth creating, we find it’s worth maintaining.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Collaborate </span></p>
<p>While not a milestone, a first, best practice is to setup an extranet site where stakeholders can collaborate on the project. Popular platforms for collaborative sites include ShareProint, Google Apps, BaseCamp, Office Online, and Open Atrium. All of these platforms make it easy to share and exchange documents and messages throughout the course of a project.</p>
<p>Regardless of what other BABOK techniques we use in a requirements project, we find that if we include these five milestones – Charter, Survey, Plan, Specify, and Correct – we’re well on the way to a successful launch.</p>

        <p>In the beginning, we programmed computers with toggle switches and punched cards. Next came the command line interface (CLI) and today’s graphical user interace (GUI). Before long, there will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface" target="_blank" rel="external">brain computer interaces</a> (BCI), but for today, we’re faced with GUIs.</p>
<p><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://screenshot-program.com/fireshot/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://screenshot-program.com/images/fireshot_thumb.gif" alt=""></a></div><br>Anyone involved in software development, training, or support spends a great deal of time discussing what is on, or what will go on, a computer screen. A well-designed set of screens expose not only the application’s features, they steer users toward using the right feature at the right time. A very well designed application will even display screens with error messages that actually pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>Many UI discussions take place remotely or asynchronously. The other end of the discussion is either not in the room or not available while the display is on your screen. If someone is not looking over your shoulder, an actual screen shot can be the best way to get your point across.</p>
<p>On the Windows platform, Ctrl+PrntScrn and Paint is still a screen-capture option, but adding comments to a screen in Paint is too much like work. A number of screen capture utilities have rushed in to fill the gap, including <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5208774" target="_blank" rel="external">SnagIt</a> and <a href="http://screenshot-program.com/fireshot/" target="_blank" rel="external">FireShot</a>, <a href="http://alternativeto.net/software/fireshot/" target="_blank" rel="external">among many others</a>.</p>
<p>I like FireShot for it’s simplicity. It’s available for FireFox and Internet Explorer. The easiest way to get started is to snag the free FireFox plugin at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5648/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5648/</a>. (I’ve never been able to get IE versions to work myself.)</p>
<p>Once installed, FireShot puts a friendly [S] icon at the end of the address bar. Select the icon (or pressing the hotkey Ctrl+Alt+Z) and FireShot will capture the contents of your browser’s screen, either the current view or full page. With any capture, you have the options of saving, editing, copying, printing, or emailing. You can even open up the capture in an external editor.</p>
<p>I find the internal FireShot editor intuitive to use. It’s easy to overlay the screen capture with arrows and boxes with your own comments, and save the result.</p>
<p>One key feature lacking in the free version is the ability to save files for future editing. A project file format, and much more is part of <a href="http://screenshot-program.com/features.php" target="_blank" rel="external">the professional version, Screenshot Studio</a> ($60).</p>
<p>Screen shots are indispensable when submitting bug reports or creating training manuals for any browser-based application. If you don’t have a screen capture utility on board now, fire up Mozilla and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5648/" target="_blank" rel="external">snag yourself a copy of FireShot</a>.</p>

        <p>A growing twist in web application requirements is a request for compatibility with mobile phones, especially iPhones. Of course, Apple’s latest touchscreen device, the iPad, is #2 on everyone’s list, with a bullet.</p>
<p><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.dailystoke.com/surfing/intel-shows-off-a-web-surfing-surfboard/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://www.dailystoke.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/surf-the-web-while-on-surfboard-150x150.jpg" alt=""></a></div><br>The good news is that modern mobile devices are also using modern browsers. Supporting the iPad is not much different than supporting Safari on a Mac. But here are some gotchas to keep in mind if mobile support comes up in your next web requirements meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No Flash support - Many sites sprinkle in Flash a little sizzle and some others can’t function without it. Most mobile devices, like the iPad, don’t support Flash. If mobile support is important, don’t require Flash to access key features.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sketchy online office support - Many online office environments, like Google Docs and Zoho, use controls that are not being supported with the iPad out of the box. If an online office is part of your web site mix, be sure to call out restrictions for iPad users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Smaller screens at standard resolution - Today, most web site are designing around a 1024x768 resolution, which is supported by netbooks and many mobile devices. But, don’t push the resolution envelope, or you will start to lose the bleeding edge. Also be sure that visual elements and typefaces are not so small as to be inscrutible on a smaller screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, most web applications should be good to go with the latest and greatest in mobile technologies.</p>

        <p>ASI watchers may have noticed an uptick in patches lately. That’s no fluke says Mark Breland of ASI. It’s all part of an initiative to shorten development cycles and put code improvements into the field sooner.</p>
<p>One offshoot of that development initiative is ASI’s plans to open source its IBO product. iBO (iMIS Business Objects) is the standard way to integrate iMIS with other products or one-off customizations.</p>
<p><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://opensource.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://opensource.org/files/garland_logo.png" alt=""></a></div><br>ASI is working with its partners community version of iBO. Following up on a recent webinar, ASI has invited several interested volunteers to form a steering committee to manage an open source community product spun off from the current iBO code base. Five volunteers were on the kickoff call – Bruce Wilson (McGladrey), Randy Richter (Association Technology Solutions), Jason Voccia (Computer System Innovations), Ted Husted (NimbleUser), and Troy Stenback (ASI Consulting) – along with Mark Breland of ASI.</p>
<p>The working plan is that ASI will donate the code and host a repository and case management system, and provide a collaborative space for the project. ASI will continue to maintain its own “enterprise” version separately, and the ASI version will be the only code base supported by ASI itself. Meanwhile, the steering committee will have full control over the “community” version, leaving us free to apply whatever patches or improvements to the “community” version as we deem fit.</p>
<p>While some of the volunteers (including myself) are concerned about creating a “fork” of the iBO code base, we came to see it as a stepping stone toward a more complete open source model. Our hope is that ASI will adopt our fixes and improvements into the “enterprise” version, and also supply patches to the “community” version, to help the code bases remain in sync. Initially, =each code base would be maintained separately, and ASI will remain in complete control of the official “enterprise” version.</p>
<p>The committee’s hope is that once we prove ourselves, we might be able to reunite the codebases in the future. But, in the meantime, we are eager to make the best use of the enterprise/community model.</p>
<p>Our next steps are to draft our “Rules of Engagement”, setup a mailing list, and look to ASI to setup the repository and case tracking tools, and settle some of the loose ends with Legal. I caught the short straw for drafting the Rules, but I can draw on experience with open source projects like Apache Struts and the Jakarta Commons, to help give us a solid starting point.</p>
<p>As a note, there are similarities between the Open iBO initiatve and the origin of Apache Tomcat. Sun originally donated a Java plugin to the Apache Software Foundation. Under the name “Tomcat”, the ASF  extended and rewrote the codebase, and over the years, the ASF grew the product into a full-featured web server. A recent market survey indicates that today Tomcat has a 64% market share (<a href="http://ztrek.blogspot.com/2007/10/bea-oracle-market-share.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://ztrek.blogspot.com/2007/10/bea-oracle-market-share.html</a>).</p>
<p>Keep watch here for further news about Open Source iBO. I’m looking forward to living through some “interesting times” with ASI.<br>-Ted.</p>
